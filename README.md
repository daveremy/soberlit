# Sober Lit: Thriving After 60 Without Alcohol

This repo holds drafts, research logs, and annotated references for a personal, evidence-first book project. It’s written for my current situation—retired life with alcohol woven into routines—and aims to map the real effects of alcohol, dismantle myths, and build a “Sober Lit” program.

## Structure
- `drafts/`: chapter and solutions drafts (situation, myths, cardio, cancer, brain/sleep, falls, meds, mental health, foreword, solutions components).
- `research_log.md`: study notes, quotes, effect sizes, and how to use them.
- `appendix_references.md`: annotated, tagged references (tags like `[Wood2018]` used inline in drafts).
- `book_outline.md`: top-level chapter map and gaps.

## Citations
Drafts use tags (e.g., `[Wood2018]`) that link to `appendix_references.md` for full citations and summaries. The log keeps verbatim quotes/effects for traceability.

## Status
- Problem/evidence chapters drafted and tagged.
- Solutions drafted: hydration/substitutes, social scripts, movement starter, sleep ritual, 30/60/90 plan. Remaining: expand other solution pillars if desired.
