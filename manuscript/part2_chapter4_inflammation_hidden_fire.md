## Part II — The Audit: Alcohol, Aging, and Capacity

In Part I, you saw how men like us tend to drift when we stop paying attention, and you saw a picture of who you are choosing to become instead: the Integrated Man.

Part II is where we look under the hood. We treat alcohol not as a moral issue, but as a systems problem. We will audit one system at a time and ask a simple set of questions:

- What does this system look like in a typical man in his sixties or seventies?  
- What does alcohol do to it, especially after 60?  
- How does that translate into lost capacity and lost agency?

We are going to start with something that can feel abstract but touches almost everything else: **inflammation**.

Before we talk about heart attacks or dementia, we need to talk about the sludge in the engine.

### Chapter 4 — Inflammation and the Hidden Fire

Before we talk about heart attacks or dementia, we need to talk about the sludge in the engine.

You know the feeling. You wake up stiff. Your joints ache. Your energy is low until the second cup of coffee. You look in the mirror and see puffiness in your face that was not there ten years ago.

You call it “getting old.”

Science calls it **inflammaging**.

I call it **the hidden fire**.

And if you are drinking alcohol regularly, you are pouring fuel on it.

In this chapter, we are not going to chase every pathway or molecule. We are going to understand enough of the mechanism to see why inflammation matters so much after 60, and why removing alcohol is one of the simplest ways to reduce it.

#### Acute Fire vs. Chronic Smoke

Your immune system is not your enemy. When you cut your finger, catch a virus, or bang your knee, you need an inflammatory response. Cells rush to the site, clean up debris, fight invaders, and help you heal.

That is **acute inflammation**. It has a beginning and an end. The fire flares, does its job, and goes out.

**Chronic inflammation** is different. It is like a fire that never quite goes out. There is a constant, low‑grade smoldering in the background—enough to damage structures over time, not enough to grab your attention on any given day.

After 60, the body tends to drift toward this smoldering state. Baseline inflammatory markers creep up. The immune system becomes less precise. It reacts more, and it resolves less.

That age‑related rise in background inflammation is what researchers mean by **inflammaging**. It is one of the common threads linking many diseases of aging:

- Atherosclerosis and heart disease.  
- Some cancers.  
- Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.  
- Osteoarthritis and joint pain.  
- Neurodegenerative diseases.

You cannot eliminate inflammaging completely. But you can avoid throwing gasoline on the fire.

Alcohol is gasoline.

#### How Alcohol Turns Up the Heat

There are several ways alcohol increases inflammation. One of the best‑understood starts in your gut.

The short version:

- Alcohol irritates and damages the lining of your intestines.  
- The tight junctions between cells loosen.  
- Bacterial products that are supposed to stay inside the gut leak into the bloodstream.  
- Your immune system sees those products where they do not belong and goes to war.  
- That war is mediated by inflammatory signals that circulate throughout your body.

You do not feel “a leaky gut.” You feel:

- More fatigue.  
- More joint soreness.  
- More brain fog.  
- Less resilience after exertion.

At the same time, alcohol influences:

- The balance of bacteria in your gut.  
- Oxidative stress in the liver and other tissues.  
- Hormones and signaling molecules involved in immune responses.

You do not need the full biochemistry. What you need is the operational understanding:

> Every drink is not just a hit to your liver. It is a nudge to your entire immune system toward a more inflammatory baseline.

After 60, when your baseline is already higher, those nudges add up.

#### Visceral Fat: The Inflammation Organ

There is another player in this story: the fat around your organs, especially in your abdomen.

This is not the subcutaneous fat you can pinch at your waist. It is the deeper, internal fat that rounds the belly and thickens the midsection.

That **visceral fat** is not inert storage. It behaves like an organ. It secretes inflammatory molecules, hormones, and other signals into your bloodstream.

Alcohol promotes visceral fat in several ways:

- It adds calories your body does not need and is not likely to burn off.  
- It interferes with fat burning, pushing your body to store more.  
- It disrupts sleep, which affects appetite and metabolic regulation.

Visceral fat, in turn, feeds back into inflammation. The more of it you carry, the more inflammatory signals are in circulation—even when you are not acutely injured or sick.

Visceral fat is not just an aesthetic issue. It is a 24/7 inflammation machine.

#### Why This Matters for Capacity After 60

You might reasonably ask: “All right, inflammation is higher. So what? How does that show up in my life?”

For a man in his sixties or seventies, higher baseline inflammation is not an abstract lab value. It is a steady thief of capacity.

It shows up as:

- **Slower recovery:** The hike or tournament that used to cost you a day now costs you three.  
- **More joint stiffness and pain:** Knees, hips, and hands that feel older than the rest of you.  
- **More brain fog:** Harder time focusing, remembering details, or sustaining attention.  
- **More vulnerability to disease:** Higher risk for heart disease, some cancers, diabetes, and possibly faster progression of neurodegenerative conditions.

None of these things are caused only by alcohol. But alcohol makes all of them worse in a system that is already less forgiving.

If you think about aging as a war for capacity, chronic inflammation is one of the main battlefields.

You can attack it from several sides:

- Moving more.  
- Building and maintaining muscle.  
- Getting enough sleep.  
- Eating in ways that do not constantly spike blood sugar and insulin.  
- Managing stress.

But for many men, the single most potent, immediate move is simply to **stop adding alcohol to the mix.**

#### What Changes When You Remove Alcohol

When men in our age bracket stop drinking, one of the most common surprises is how quickly their bodies feel different.

Within weeks, many report:

- Less puffiness in the face and hands.  
- Less morning stiffness.  
- Fewer random aches and pains.  
- More consistent energy through the day.

Their lab work often changes more slowly than their subjective experience. That does not make the experience imaginary. It reflects the fact that inflammation is not just numbers on a panel, but how your tissues are being treated every hour.

You may not notice how much of your “feeling old” is actually “feeling inflamed” until you remove a major inflammatory driver.

Removing alcohol does not guarantee you will never ache again or never develop an inflammatory disease. But it stops you from deliberately adding a known inflammatory load to a system that is already fighting gravity and time.

#### The Integrated Man’s Frame on Inflammation

As an Integrated Man, you are not chasing perfect lab values. You are chasing capacity, agency, and meaning.

Inflammation is relevant insofar as it affects those goals.

So the questions you will learn to ask are:

- “Does this choice increase or decrease my ability to train, compete, and recover?”  
- “Does this pattern of eating, drinking, and sleeping make my joints and brain feel older or younger?”  
- “Am I designing my life to lower unnecessary inflammatory load, or am I tolerating a slow burn because it is convenient?”

In later chapters and toolkits, we will talk about specific anti‑inflammatory moves beyond alcohol: movement, sleep, nutrition, stress management.

For now, the key point is simple:

> In your sixties and beyond, chronic inflammation is not background noise. It is one of the main ways your body loses capacity. Alcohol quietly turns the volume up.

In the next chapter, we will look at one of the most obvious places that shows up: your heart and blood vessels. You will see how the hidden fire interacts with the pump and the pipes—and what that means for the man who wants to keep competing, traveling, and living independently into his seventies and eighties.
