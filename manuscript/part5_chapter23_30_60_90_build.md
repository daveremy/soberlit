## Part V — The Integration Manual: Execution Over Time

### Chapter 23 — The 30/60/90‑Day Build

The first two weeks were about crossing the bridge safely: moving alcohol out of the center of your operating system, stabilizing sleep as best you could, and getting basic hydration and food online.

Now we widen the horizon.

Ninety days is not a magic spell. It is a reasonable unit of time for:

- Rewriting habit loops.  
- Building visible strength and endurance.  
- Feeling the early impact of better sleep and movement on mood.  
- Beginning to live as an Integrated Man rather than as “a guy who used to drink more.”

You already have the components:

- A Blueprint for who you are becoming.  
- Toolkits for Body & Capacity, Food & Supplements, Mind & Mood, Social & Relationships, Spirit & Meaning, Money & Optionality, Order & Environment, and Alcohol‑Free implementation, all laid out in Part IV.

This chapter is not here to teach you new concepts. It is here to **sequence** what you already have.

Think of it as a **systems integration plan**:

- 0–30 days: Consolidate the basics and bring the physical chassis online.  
- 30–60 days: Layer in mental performance and learning.  
- 60–90 days: Deepen relationships, meaning, and long‑term structure.

You will not follow this with military precision. You will use it as a template and adjust for your life, sport, health, and obligations.

### How to Use This Chapter

High‑agency men hate being micromanaged. You did not reach this stage of life by following someone else’s daily checklist.

So we will stay at the level that respects you:

- **Phases, not days.** We will talk about rough windows—0–30, 30–60, 60–90 days—knowing that your actual experience will not line up perfectly with calendar pages.  
- **Weekly mission intent, not 47 action items.** Each phase has 1–2 main missions. Within those missions, you pick a small set of tools from the relevant toolkits.  
- **Domains, not silos.** In each phase we will look across Body & Capacity + Food, Mind & Mood, Social & Relationships, and the “supporting systems” of Spirit, Money, and Order.

You do not need to implement every suggestion. You need to make clear, conscious choices about:

- What you will focus on now.  
- What you will defer.  
- What does not apply to you.

If a phase takes longer than 30 days, so be it. This is your system.

---

### Phase 1 (Days ~15–30): Build the Chassis

**Mission:** Consolidate alcohol change, stabilize sleep, and establish a basic physical and nutritional chassis that can support harder work later.

By this point, you have:

- Two weeks of experience living with less or no alcohol.  
- Some sense of how your sleep, energy, and cravings respond.  
- Early wins and early disappointments.

The temptation now is to “make up for lost time” by over‑building. Resist that. The job of Phase 1 is to **get the fundamentals reliable**.

#### Body & Capacity + Food

From the Body & Capacity and Food & Supplements toolkits in Part IV, choose a **minimal but consistent** pattern:

- **Strength:**  
  - 2 sessions per week from Strength Block A (home or gym version), at a level that keeps you comfortably in the Green zone. Focus on the basics: squats, hinges, pushes, pulls, carries.  
- **Conditioning:**  
  - 3–5 sessions per week of Zone 2‑style work (brisk walking, rucking, cycling, easy swimming) in the 20–40 minute range. These can be combined with strength days.  
- **Prehab:**  
  - 2–3 short prehab blocks per week, chosen based on your weak points—hips and knees, feet and balance, or shoulders and spine.  
- **Food & hydration:**  
  - Run the Phase 0 defaults consistently: protein‑anchored breakfast, clear protein at lunch and dinner, half‑plate plants, and visible hydration habits.

You are not chasing personal bests yet. You are establishing that:

- You move your body most days.  
- You eat in a way that supports training instead of sabotaging it.  
- Your joints, tendons, and balance are getting attention before they fail.

If you have a serious sport (pickleball, golf, running, cycling), treat it in this window as **practice**, not peak competition. Keep intensity moderate and focus on skill and consistency.

#### Mind & Mood

Your nervous system is still recalibrating. You do not need elaborate introspection.

From the Mind & Mood toolkit, pick a small set of tools:

- **Daily State Check‑In:** morning or early evening, with a quick note on energy, mood, and any cravings.  
- **H‑HALT awareness:** when you feel off, ask which H‑HALT light is most likely on and address that first.  
- **Pause Protocol:** for urges and spikes, maintain the 10–15 minute buffer you used in the first two weeks.

The mission here is to **notice patterns**:

- When does energy dip?  
- What situations reliably trigger cravings or irritability?  
- How does movement affect mood the same day and the day after?

You can treat this as installing basic instrumentation on a system you intend to run for a long time.

#### Social & Relationships

Most of your social architecture can wait until later phases. For now:

- Maintain **low‑risk contact** with a few supportive people.  
- Let one or two trusted allies know what you are doing and what you might need (for example, a weekly call, a standing walk, or someone you can text before a high‑risk event).  
- Use simple social scripts from the Social & Relationship toolkit when alcohol comes up: “I sleep and train better without it, so I’m taking a long break.”

You are not testing yourself in loud, high‑temptation environments yet. You are building quiet, reliable support.

#### Alcohol‑Free Maintenance

From the Alcohol‑Free Implementation toolkit, keep:

- The environment changes that have been working (placement of bottles, non‑alcoholic options).  
- The basic rules around high‑risk times and places.  
- The agreement with yourself that slips, if they occur, are to be analyzed, not dramatized.

Phase 1 is often where men discover whether their initial plan was realistic. If it was too aggressive or too loose, this is the time to adjust—with your physician if needed.

---

### Phase 2 (Days ~30–60): Sharpen the Mind and the Sport

**Mission:** Use your improving sleep, capacity, and chemistry to deepen training and mental engagement, while keeping alcohol in the background as a non‑option.

By around day 30, many men notice:

- More consistent sleep.  
- Clearer mornings.  
- Less volatile mood.  
- Early changes in body composition or sport performance.

This is the window to **aim that improved capacity**.

#### Body & Capacity + Food

If Phase 1 went reasonably well, you can modestly increase load, drawing on the same Body & Capacity and Food & Supplements toolkits:

- **Strength:**  
  - Move toward 2–3 strength sessions per week. You may introduce elements of Strength Block B (slightly heavier, fewer reps) if your joints and floor test are in the Green zone and your doctor agrees.  
- **Conditioning:**  
  - Maintain 3–5 Zone 2 sessions, potentially lengthening one session slightly if recovery is good.  
- **Sport:**  
  - Begin to treat your chosen sport more deliberately: schedule practice sessions, work on specific skills, and, if appropriate, enter low‑stakes competitive events.

On the food side:

- Keep protein in the **1.2–1.6 g/kg ideal body weight** range if medically appropriate.  
- Keep plants and fiber high to support gut health and blood sugar stability.  
- Consider whether small, data‑guided tweaks (for example, reducing late‑night heavy meals) improve sleep and training further.

You can also begin to track a **small number of metrics** more formally if that motivates you: for example, a weekly strength benchmark, a walking or cycling distance, or simple sport performance markers.

#### Mind & Mood

This is a good time to lean into **Drive and Neutral** from the Mind & Mood toolkit:

- **Drive:**  
  - Choose a meaningful project that requires effort and learning: improving a specific aspect of your sport, building something, teaching, or a technical or creative endeavor.  
  - Protect several 60–90 minute blocks per week for this work.  
- **Neutral:**  
  - Maintain at least one intentional “neutral gear” period per day: a walk without headphones, sitting on the porch, time in nature without devices.

If you have been considering therapy or coaching—for grief, long‑standing patterns, or performance—this is often a better time to start than during the first two weeks. You now have more bandwidth to use that support.

#### Social & Relationships

With a bit more stability, you can work on **crew and rhythm**:

- From your Relationship Map, identify 2–4 people you want closer.  
- Establish one or two **recurring activities**: a weekly walk, a standing game, a regular lunch, a project.  
- Begin to show up more fully in family roles: not by grand gestures, but by consistency—calls returned, visits planned, presence during conversations.

You can also run low‑risk social experiments:

- Attend an event where you used to drink, with a clear plan and exit strategy.  
- Notice how people actually respond to you ordering a non‑alcoholic drink (usually, they do not care).  
- Debrief afterward: what went well, what was hard, what you would adjust.

#### Spirit, Money, and Order (Light Touch)

You do not need to overhaul your spiritual life, finances, or environment in this window. You can, however, take one step in each, using the relevant toolkits in Part IV:

- **Spirit & Meaning:**  
  - Choose one grounding practice—brief meditation, presence walks, or a simple prayer/reflective routine—and run it most days.  
- **Money & Optionality:**  
  - Note, without judgment, where the “sober dividend” is going: the money you are not spending on alcohol. Deliberately allocate at least a portion of it to a specific capacity, connection, or learning move—an appointment with a physical therapist, a block of coaching, a piece of gear that reduces injury risk, a weekend trip with family or crew.  
- **Order & Environment:**  
  - Run one small Order block per week: clear a path, consolidate a drawer, tighten up a digital system.

The point is momentum, not completion.

### Phase 3 (Days ~60–90): Integration and Identity Consolidation

**Mission:** Embed the Integrated Man identity in daily life—sport, relationships, inner life, and use of time and money—so that alcohol is clearly just one small subsystem, not a central character.

By around day 60, if you have been reasonably consistent, you may notice:

- Your energy and mood are more predictable.  
- Your training and sport performance are trending in the right direction.  
- Social scripts are less awkward.  
- Cravings, if present, are more situational than constant.

This is the phase where many men shift from “trying not to drink” to simply **living a different life**.

#### Body & Capacity + Food

At this point, the goal is to **maintain and refine**, not to constantly escalate:

- Keep your strength, conditioning, and prehab blocks on a schedule you can sustain.  
- Match training load to your sport season: more emphasis before tournaments or key events, more maintenance in between.  
- Use periodic deload weeks to avoid overuse injuries.

Food should now feel less like a project and more like a **default pattern**:

- Protein anchors in each meal.  
- Plenty of plants.  
- Hydration habits automatic enough that you rarely get behind.  
- Alcohol no longer part of the fuel system.

If weight, body composition, or specific lab values are still far from where you and your doctor would like them, this is the time to consider more targeted adjustments—with professional input—not crash diets.

#### Mind & Mood

With the basics in place, you can focus on **cognitive reserve and relevance**:

- Deepen your chosen project or pick a new one with a 6–12 month horizon.  
- Mix learning and output: read, but also teach, write, or build.  
- Maintain cognitive hygiene: limits on news and screen noise, worry capture, and sleep‑protective boundaries.

If depressive, anxious, or obsessive symptoms remain heavy despite changes in alcohol, sleep, and movement, treat that as data that more help is needed, not as proof you are failing. At this stage, a conversation with a mental‑health professional can be particularly productive because you have already addressed several major lifestyle variables.

#### Social & Relationships

Now you are building **durable architecture**:

- Turn one of your crew rhythms into a long‑term anchor: a weekly game, a monthly hike, a recurring dinner. Put it on the calendar like a standing meeting.  
- As capacity and trust build, consider small, appropriate disclosures with people who have earned them: what you are changing and why.  
- In family life, look for concrete ways to be useful: teaching skills, underwriting experiences, helping quietly with logistics.

This is also a good window to address lingering misalignments:

- A recurring point of friction with your partner.  
- A pattern of over‑commitment or under‑commitment in community roles.  
- A boundary you have been avoiding setting.

The question is always: “How would the Integrated Man handle this?” Then you do the next small piece of that.

#### Spirit, Money, and Order

By 60–90 days, many men feel ready for deeper passes in these domains.

- **Spirit & Meaning:**  
  - Use the Mortality & Regret work from the Spirit & Meaning toolkit to begin shaping the next decade: Five Good Years exercises, values clarification, and early legacy projects.  
- **Money & Optionality:**  
  - Have at least one structured conversation—with a partner if you have one, and ideally with an advisor—about using resources for capacity, agency, and connection in the next 5–10 years. Identify one or two specific shifts you can make now, guided by the Money & Optionality toolkit.  
- **Order & Environment:**  
  - Tackle one higher‑impact area: a garage that affects daily function, key paperwork and the Red Folder, or a heavily used room that needs to match the life you are now living, using patterns from the Order, Logistics, and Environment toolkit.

You are not trying to finish everything in 90 days. You are proving to yourself that these domains are in motion, not neglected.

#### Alcohol‑Free as Background

By this phase, alcohol should be **one of the easier variables** most days:

- Your environment is set up to support your current identity.  
- Your sport, projects, and relationships are interesting enough that you are not chasing artificial drama.  
- Your body remembers the difference between mornings with and without alcohol on board.

You will still encounter situations where a drink is offered, expected, or looks tempting. The difference now is that:

- You know what is at stake in your capacity graph.  
- You have other tools to handle boredom, celebration, grief, and stress.  
- You have enough lived data to argue against the old stories.

You are not “in recovery” as a full‑time job. You are running an integrated system where alcohol simply no longer makes operational sense.

### At the 90‑Day Mark

When you reach roughly 90 days from the beginning of serious change, do not just drift past the milestone. Run a **systems review**, not a self‑esteem review.

Sit down with your notes, your calendar, and, if you use them, any basic metrics (weight, blood pressure, labs, sport benchmarks) and ask:

- **Body & Capacity:** What can I do now that I could not easily do three months ago? What hurts less? What still feels fragile?  
- **Food & Supplements:** Which defaults are now automatic? Where do I still fall back into old patterns?  
- **Mind & Mood:** How often am I in Drive, Neutral, and Reverse now compared to three months ago? What helps me move in the right direction?  
- **Social & Relationships:** Who is more in my life? Who is less? Do I have at least a minimal crew rhythm?  
- **Spirit & Meaning:** Have I started any practice that helps me face mortality, regret, or gratitude more directly?  
- **Money & Order:** Have I made even one concrete move toward using resources and environment in line with the life I say I want?  
- **Alcohol:** How often do I think about drinking compared with three months ago? What situations still feel high‑risk? What is my plan for those?

This is not about perfection. It is about making the system visible.

### A Sample Week in Practice

To make this less abstract, here is what a fairly typical week might look like for an Integrated Man finishing the 90‑day build. This is an example, not a prescription:

- **Monday:** Morning walk (Zone 2) and short prehab block; afternoon project work; evening presence with partner, no late screens.  
- **Tuesday:** Strength Block A session; light sport practice; simple protein‑anchored meals; brief Spirit practice (walk or meditation).  
- **Wednesday:** Longer walk or easy bike; call with an ally or crew member; small Order task (clear a drawer, pay a nagging bill).  
- **Thursday:** Strength Block A or B; targeted sport practice; Mind & Mood “Drive” block on a learning or build project.  
- **Friday:** Short conditioning session; social time with partner, family, or crew—dinner you cook, movie at home, or an early match, alcohol‑free by default.  
- **Saturday:** Sport as honest test (match, round, hike, event); simple recovery walk later in the day; note one thing you learned.  
- **Sunday:** Rest or very light movement; weekly reflection (what went well, what was hard, one adjustment for next week); brief check‑in on money, schedule, and upcoming commitments.

You would tune this for your sport, your obligations, and your body. The point is that by this stage, the toolkits are not theory—they are visible in how you spend your days.

In the next chapter, we will zoom out further. The horizon will be **years**, not months.

We will talk about:

- Quarterly and annual reviews.  
- Adjusting for health events, financial changes, and family developments.  
- Keeping sport, learning, and service alive in your seventies and beyond.  
- Facing mortality directly without giving in to either denial or resignation.

For now, if you have walked through these 90 days with even partial fidelity to the missions, you are not the same man who started.

You are no longer trying to “quit drinking.” You are running an integrated life where alcohol has been demoted from operator to obsolete tool.
