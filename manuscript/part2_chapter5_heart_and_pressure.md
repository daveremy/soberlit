## Part II — The Audit: Alcohol, Aging, and Capacity

### Chapter 5 — The Pump: Heart, Pressure, and Staying in the Game

If inflammation is the hidden fire, your heart is the pump that has to keep working in that heat.

For men in their sixties and beyond, the cardiovascular system is one of the most common points of failure. It is why you take blood pressure readings, swallow statins, and pay attention when your chest feels tight or your heart feels off.

You have probably heard some version of the story that “a little red wine is good for the heart.” You may even have repeated it, half jokingly, as a justification.

In this chapter, we are going to treat your heart and vessels the way you used to treat a critical system in your work: as a **pressurized, electrically timed, aging piece of equipment** that you still want to perform under load.

And we are going to look at what alcohol actually does to that system, especially after 60.

#### The Hydraulics: Blood Pressure Under Load

Your cardiovascular system is a hydraulic network.

Your heart generates pressure. Your vessels distribute that pressure. Your kidneys, nervous system, and hormones help regulate it.

Alcohol acts on this system in several phases.

At first, it can dilate blood vessels, which may make you feel warm and relaxed. But as your body metabolizes it, your nervous system responds with a rebound: stress hormones rise, blood vessels constrict again, and your heart has to work harder.

If you are like most men in this age band, you are already managing blood pressure with medication, lifestyle changes, or both. Every drink is a small counter‑force to that work:

- In the morning, you take a pill to help lower pressure and protect your vessels.  
- In the evening, you ingest a solvent that pushes pressure and stress the other way.

Over weeks and months, that tug‑of‑war matters.

Large analyses of people who cut down on alcohol show that reducing intake consistently lowers blood pressure in a dose‑dependent way. Even moderate reductions can shave several points off your systolic pressure—enough to move you from “borderline” into safer territory, or to reduce the amount of medication you need [Roerecke2017].

For a man who wants to keep climbing stairs, playing sport, and avoiding strokes, that is not a theoretical win. It is the difference between your heart working at a comfortable fraction of its capacity or constantly running hot.

There is another layer here. Many men in our season are on blood pressure medications—beta‑blockers, ACE inhibitors, sometimes diuretics. Those drugs are trying to keep your hydraulics within a safer range. Alcohol both pushes pressure up and can make drops in pressure less predictable, especially when you stand up or are dehydrated. In system terms, you are sending the controller conflicting instructions.

#### The Electrical System: Rhythm and “Holiday Heart”

Your heart is not just a pump. It is also an electrical system.

Each beat is triggered and coordinated by a timing signal. When that signal is regular, the chambers of the heart fill and empty efficiently. When that signal is disrupted, the rhythm can become chaotic.

Alcohol is a known trigger for rhythm problems, especially **atrial fibrillation (AFib)**.

If you have ever woken up at 3 AM with your heart fluttering, pounding, or racing in a strange way after a night of drinking, you have had a brush with what doctors call “holiday heart syndrome”—alcohol‑induced arrhythmia [Voskoboinik2020].

In younger, otherwise healthy people, it may pass without obvious harm. In men over 60, AFib is a major risk factor for stroke. Clots can form in the quivering atrium and travel to the brain.

The question is not whether one drink will instantly throw you into AFib. The question is why a man who values his capacity and agency would **voluntarily increase the odds** that his heart’s timing system misfires.

You have spent a lifetime protecting critical systems from spurious signals. This is no different.

#### The “Moderate” Myth: The J‑Curve Revisited

If you pay attention to health news, you have likely seen graphs suggesting that moderate drinkers have better heart outcomes than abstainers—a so‑called **J‑shaped curve**.

For years, this was taken as evidence that a glass or two of wine might be “protective.”

You may even have had a doctor say something like, “One glass of red wine is fine.” Often, that advice was given before the newer pooled analyses were widely appreciated, or it was given as a pragmatic compromise for patients who were never going to quit. In this chapter, I am not grading on that curve. I am talking to a man who is actually willing to optimize his system.

When researchers looked more closely, a different picture emerged [Wood2018].

In many of those studies, the “abstainer” group was contaminated with people who had **stopped drinking because they were already sick**: heart disease, liver problems, other conditions that made their doctors tell them to quit. When you include those “sick quitters” in the non‑drinking group, it is no surprise that the drinkers look healthier.

When you filter those people out and compare otherwise similar men who drink modestly to those who truly abstain, the supposed advantage of alcohol shrinks or disappears.

Large pooled analyses in recent years have found that:

- Beyond roughly a drink a day, risk of stroke, heart failure, and fatal hypertension rises more or less steadily with intake.  
- Any small theoretical benefit at very low doses is swamped by risks in other systems (cancer, atrial fibrillation, blood pressure) once you look at the whole picture [Wood2018] [WHO2023].

For a man in his sixties or seventies, already closer to the fatigue limit of his cardiovascular system, this matters. You are not choosing between “healthy drinking” and “ascetic deprivation.” You are choosing between **less strain on the pump** and **more strain on the pump**.

#### Capacity, Agency, and the Pump

Why does all of this matter in the context of the Integrated Man?

Because your heart does not just keep you alive; it sets the ceiling on how fully you can live.

Better cardiovascular function means:

- You can walk faster, farther, and on steeper ground without stopping.  
- You can play longer matches without your heart rate staying sky‑high.  
- You recover more quickly between points, sets, and days.  
- You have more energy left over for the rest of your life: conversations, projects, travel.

When your pump is strained:

- You slow down or avoid activities that would otherwise bring you joy and connection.  
- You become more dependent on medications, doctors, and devices to manage basic functions.  
- Your sphere of action shrinks, even if you are technically still “alive.”

Agency in late life is not just about mindset. It is about having the cardiovascular headroom to act on your decisions.

If you track your training with a watch or ring, you can see some of this directly. Nights with alcohol often show:

- Higher resting heart rate.  
- Lower heart rate variability.  
- Poorer sleep stages and slower recovery scores.

You do not need to take anyone’s word for it. Your own data will tell you that your engine is running hotter and recovering worse on the nights you drink.

Alcohol does not remove all of that overnight. But it pushes, steadily, in the wrong direction—raising pressure, nudging rhythm, adding strain to vessels that have carried you for decades.

An Integrated Man who wants to keep competing, traveling, carrying his own bags, and walking his own routes does not ignore that.

He designs his life so that his heart is an ally, not a liability.

In the next chapter, we will move from the pump to one of the risks that often goes unnoticed until it is far advanced: how alcohol interacts with cancer risk in a man whose cells have been dividing for more than six decades.
