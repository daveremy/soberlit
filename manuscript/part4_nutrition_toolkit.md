### Food & Supplements Toolkit

In the Body & Capacity Toolkit, we treated your body like a chassis you intend to keep driving hard into your seventies and eighties: strength, conditioning, prehab, sleep, hydration, game‑day fueling.

This toolkit is about something simpler and less glamorous:

> What actually goes on your plate, and what—if anything—you add as supplements to support capacity.

You do not need a new “diet identity.” You do not need to count every gram forever. You need a **small set of defaults** that:

- Keep muscle and bone on your frame.  
- Keep your gut and blood sugar reasonably stable.  
- Support your training and competition.  
- Are simple enough that you will still be doing them five years from now.

We will keep this organized around three levers and a short, honest look at supplements.

- Three daily levers for capacity: **protein, fiber, and fluids.**  
- Simple plate patterns that work at 60+ for both health and sport.  
- A short list of **Core Four** supplements many late‑life athletes discuss with their doctors.  

You can run this whether you are training for tournaments or just trying not to “age into the chair.”

### Three Levers for Capacity

You can think of food as entertainment if you want. Your physiology does not care. It will still respond to three things with outsized impact:

- How much **protein** you get.  
- How much **fiber and plant matter** you give your gut.  
- How consistently you **drink enough fluid.**

We are not going to pretend these are the only variables that matter. But if you get these roughly right, the rest becomes easier.

#### Lever 1 — Protein: Armor and Satiety

After about 60, your muscles become less responsive to protein. Researchers call this **anabolic resistance**. Clinicians who focus on late‑life performance, including people like Peter Attia and sports‑nutrition researchers who study master athletes, keep circling the same simple conclusion:

- You need more protein per kilogram of body weight than you did at 30 to build or even maintain muscle.  
- You benefit from spreading that protein across the day instead of eating almost all of it at dinner.  

Most gerontology and sports‑medicine groups now suggest higher protein for older adults, especially if they are active, rather than the bare‑minimum 0.8 g/kg/day that shows up in many general guidelines [ProtAge2013]:

- A reasonable target for many men in their sixties and seventies is around **1.2–1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of ideal body weight per day.**  
- For a man whose healthy weight is around **80 kg / 175–180 pounds**, that is roughly **100–130 grams of protein daily**, split across meals.  

If you like even simpler heuristics and your kidneys are healthy, you can think in English units:

- Roughly **0.6–0.7 grams of protein per pound of goal body weight** per day.  
- **25–40 grams** of protein in each main meal is a useful range for most older men.

Why this matters for you:

- **Muscle and strength:** Protein plus resistance training is how you keep moving your own body and luggage in your eighties.  
- **Satiety and cravings:** A higher‑protein breakfast and lunch make late‑afternoon and evening cravings—alcohol, sugar, mindless snacking—much easier to handle.  
- **Metabolic health:** Adequate protein can help you preserve lean mass while you lose fat, which is a better trade than simply shrinking.

You do not need exotic foods. Most men hit these numbers by deliberately including one or more of:

- Eggs, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese.  
- Fish, chicken, turkey, lean cuts of beef or pork.  
- Beans and lentils, especially when combined with grains.  
- Tofu, tempeh, or other soy products if you like them.  
- A scoop of quality protein powder when convenience demands it.

You can treat protein powder as **food convenience**, not as a magic supplement: a way to make it easier to hit your daily number when you are traveling or rushed.

If you have known kidney disease or are on certain medications, you and your physician may set different targets. The principle—protect muscle—still holds.

#### Lever 2 — Fiber and Plants: Gut and Metabolic Health

Your gut microbiome, blood sugar, and bowel habits are not glamorous topics. They are part of your capacity system:

- Constipation, reflux, and irritable digestion sap energy and make training and travel harder.  
- Chronically spiking and crashing your blood sugar leaves you foggy, hungry, and more likely to reach for quick fixes in the evening.  

One of the simplest levers here is **fiber.**

For most older men, a practical target is around **25–35 grams of fiber per day**, mostly from whole foods:

- Vegetables (especially non‑starchy ones): greens, broccoli, carrots, peppers, onions.  
- Fruits, particularly berries, apples, pears.  
- Beans and lentils.  
- Whole grains like oats, barley, quinoa, brown rice.  
- Nuts and seeds in moderate amounts.

You do not have to measure every gram. You can use plate patterns:

- At **lunch and dinner**, aim for **half the plate** to be vegetables and/or beans.  
- Include **at least one piece of fruit** most days.  
- Swap highly refined starches (white bread, pastries, candy) for slower carbohydrates most of the time.

Fiber and plant diversity benefit:

- **Gut function:** More regular, more comfortable bowel movements.  
- **Metabolic health:** Smoother blood sugar curves, which support weight management and brain function.  
- **Inflammation:** There is growing evidence that a healthier gut microbiome and more plant compounds support lower chronic inflammation—good for joints, vessels, and brain.

If you have specific digestive conditions (severe IBS, inflammatory bowel disease, strictures), you will tailor this with your GI doctor. Otherwise, the pattern is simple: more plants, more often, in forms you tolerate.

#### Lever 3 — Fluids: The Simple Capacity Upgrade

We covered hydration in more detail in the Body & Capacity Toolkit. The summary is straightforward:

- For many men in their sixties or seventies with healthy hearts and kidneys, **roughly 2.5–3 liters of fluid per day** (around **85–100 ounces**) is a reasonable default, unless your doctor has told you otherwise.  
- Most of that should be **water and other low‑sugar drinks**, with modest caffeine and minimal alcohol.  
- Thirst is a blunt instrument at this age. You benefit from **visible habits:** the bottle you finish by midday, the one you finish by early evening.

Adequate hydration supports:

- Blood pressure and balance.  
- Kidney function.  
- Temperature regulation in heat.  
- Cognitive performance and sport performance.

If you have heart failure, advanced kidney disease, or are told to restrict fluids, your numbers will be different. The principle remains: **intentional hydration instead of accidental dehydration.**

You can treat the detailed guidance in the Body toolkit as your reference implementation. Here, the main point is: food and fluids are part of the same system. Dry, low‑fiber, low‑protein days are when many older men feel and perform worst.

### Phase 0 Defaults: If You Are Starting from “Behind”

Not every reader opens this book as a current competitor. Some are coming from a decade of desk work, restaurant meals, and “I’ll start after this quarter.”

If your current pattern looks more like fast food, takeout, and nibbling, you may not need a full nutrition plan. You need **Phase 0 defaults**:

1. **Upgrade breakfast from “carbs only” to “protein‑anchored.”**  
   - Swap toast and jam, pastries, or just coffee for eggs, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, or a protein smoothie plus some fruit.  
2. **At lunch and dinner, add a fist‑sized serving of protein and make half the plate plants.**  
   - It can still be a sandwich or a bowl—just make sure there is a real protein source and a visible pile of vegetables or beans.  
3. **Carry water and actually drink it.**  
   - One bottle you finish by noon, one by dinner.  
4. **Reduce, do not abolish, ultra‑processed “extras” at first.**  
   - Instead of nightly dessert and chips, pick two or three nights per week for treats and leave the others for fruit or nothing.

Run Phase 0 for **4–6 weeks** while you get your walking and basic strength work online. Then decide whether you need more precision.

### Plates, Not Diets

You do not need to join a tribe (keto, vegan, paleo) unless you want to. What you do need are **plate patterns** you can repeat:

**Everyday Plate Pattern**

- Half plate: vegetables and/or beans.  
- One quarter: protein.  
- One quarter: whole grains or starches, or more vegetables if you prefer lower carbs.  
- A modest amount of healthy fat: olive oil, nuts, avocado, or the fat in your protein.

Examples many late‑life athletes find workable:

- **Breakfast:**  
  - Greek yogurt with berries and nuts.  
  - Eggs with sautéed vegetables and a slice of whole‑grain toast.  
  - Protein smoothie with spinach, frozen berries, and a spoon of nut butter.  
- **Lunch:**  
  - Big salad with mixed greens, vegetables, beans or grains, and a clear protein (chicken, tuna, tofu, eggs).  
  - Leftover protein from dinner, reheated vegetables, and some fruit.  
- **Dinner:**  
  - Grilled fish or chicken, roasted vegetables, and potatoes or rice.  
  - Stir‑fry with tofu or beef, mixed vegetables, and rice.  
  - Bean‑based chili or stew with a side of vegetables or salad.

You will notice none of this is exotic. It does not require special products. It does require a bit of planning and a willingness to cook—or to choose differently from menus.

### Weight, Muscle, and Blood Sugar: What to Aim For

Most men in their sixties and seventies want three things at once:

- Less visceral fat.  
- Enough muscle to move confidently.  
- Blood sugar that does not swing wildly.

Food is not the only driver here, but it is a major one. A few simple principles will keep you out of trouble:

- **Do not starve yourself.** Severe calorie restriction without strength training in this decade strips muscle, not just fat. That is the opposite of what we want.  
- **Let alcohol do less of the talking.** Removing or sharply reducing alcohol often yields a quiet reduction in calories and better sleep, which helps both weight and glucose control.  
- **Shift quality first, quantity second.** Many men get meaningful results simply by moving toward higher protein, higher fiber, less ultra‑processed food, and fewer liquid calories, before ever counting anything.  
- **If you track, track lightly.** A few weeks of logging food, weight, and waist measurement can teach you which patterns move the needle. Then you can stop or taper the tracking.

If you have diabetes or pre‑diabetes, you will layer your endocrinologist’s advice on top of these patterns. The aim remains the same: protect muscle, keep glucose swings modest, and avoid crash‑diets that leave you weaker.

### Supplements: The Core Four and the Caveats

Supplements are a high‑interest topic for men like you. The danger is turning them into a hobby while ignoring basics.

Think of supplements as **small multipliers on top of good food, training, sleep, and hydration**, not as substitutes.

There are four non‑exotic supplements many late‑life athletes at least discuss with their physicians. Consider this a **conversation starter**, not a prescription. The details and dosing always live between you and your doctor; the outline here is based on common practice and emerging evidence in older adults [ProtAge2013] [CreatineMeta2023].

**1. Creatine Monohydrate**

- **Why:** Good evidence for supporting muscle strength and power, and emerging evidence for cognitive support in some contexts. Widely studied, inexpensive.  
- **Typical dose:** Around **3–5 grams per day** for many adults.  
- **Notes:** Generally safe in healthy people, but if you have kidney disease or are on certain medications, you need a medical conversation first.

**2. Vitamin D**

- **Why:** Important for bone health, muscle function, and immune support. Many older adults, especially those who live at higher latitudes or mostly indoors, are low.  
- **Dosing:** Highly individual and best guided by a blood test. Many physicians recommend daily doses in the **1,000–2,000 IU** range, adjusted based on labs.  
- **Notes:** More is not always better. Overshooting can cause problems; this is a lab‑guided supplement.

**3. Magnesium**

- **Why:** Supports muscle function, nerve conduction, and sleep quality. Many diets are low in magnesium‑rich foods.  
- **Typical dose:** Often in the **200–400 mg per day** range from supplements, usually as glycinate, citrate, or similar forms that are easier on digestion.  
- **Notes:** High doses can cause loose stools. Men with kidney disease need medical guidance.

**4. Omega‑3 Fatty Acids (EPA/DHA)**

- **Why:** Support cardiovascular health, may help with triglycerides and inflammation. If you eat fatty fish rarely, supplements can help close the gap.  
- **Typical dose:** Often **1–2 grams of combined EPA + DHA per day**, depending on diet and cardiovascular risk.  
- **Notes:** If you are on blood thinners or have bleeding disorders, talk with your doctor first.

Beyond these, there are thousands of products marketed to men our age. A few simple rules will keep you sane:

- **Do the big rocks first.** If your protein, fiber, and hydration are poor and you are sleeping badly, supplements are polishing the hubcaps on a car without an engine.  
- **Change one thing at a time.** If you add a supplement, add just one for a few weeks so you can tell whether it helps or causes side effects.  
- **Retire what does not earn its keep.** If you cannot tell what a pill is doing after a fair trial, let it go.

As always, your personal medical history matters. Bring your full list of supplements and medications to your physician at least once a year and ask explicitly about interactions and redundancy.

### Fueling Around Sport: A Quick Tie‑In

We already outlined basic game‑day fuel in the Body & Capacity Toolkit. The goal here is simply to connect the dots:

- **Before training or competition:**  
  - You want to arrive **fed but not stuffed**: some protein and easily digestible carbohydrates in the 1–3 hours beforehand. Think yogurt and fruit, toast with peanut butter, a banana and a handful of nuts—not a heavy feast.  
- **During longer sessions (90+ minutes):**  
  - Small, familiar snacks and steady fluids prevent you from “bonking” and making poor decisions.  
- **Afterward:**  
  - Within a couple of hours, a meal that looks like your Everyday Plate Pattern, with **a clear serving of protein**, some carbohydrates to replenish, and fluids.

This is not endurance‑sport nutrition doctrine. It is simple, repeatable structure so that your sport days do not become experiments in under‑fueling and over‑drinking.

### Bringing It Back to Agency

You cannot control how many birthdays you get. You do control, to a surprising degree, **how much capacity you bring to the birthdays you do get.**

Food and supplements are not about perfection or purity. They are about:

- Keeping enough muscle and stability to move freely.  
- Giving your gut, liver, and vessels conditions they can work with.  
- Supporting your mind and mood instead of constantly fighting your own biology.  
- Making it easier, not harder, to live as an Integrated Man who trains, competes, learns, and shows up for other people.

You do not need to overhaul everything this week.

You do need to decide which lever you will pull **first**: protein, fiber, or fluids—and then let that decision show up on your plate tomorrow.
