# Sober Lit: Thriving After 60 Without Alcohol — Working Outline

> Problem/evidence-first structure; solutions later.

## Part I — The Situation & Misconceptions
- **Chapter: The Situation** (`drafts/situation.md`)
  - Retired-life patterns, physiology shifts, polypharmacy, normalization.
  - Crosswalk to harm areas.
- **Chapter: Misconceptions** (`drafts/myths_vs_reality.md`)
  - Cultural/psychological misconceptions NOT covered in evidence chapters
  - French Paradox, Social Lubricant, "I Deserve It" reward myth, "It's Too Late" at 60
  - "Boring Sobriety," "I'm not an alcoholic so I don't have a problem"
  - Narrative prose, not bullet points; mini-essays with fresh perspectives

## Part II — The Harms (Evidence Chapters)
- **1. Chronic Inflammation: The Hidden Fire** (`drafts/inflammation.md`)
  - Foundational mechanism driving all harms.
  - Inflammaging after 60 (baseline inflammation elevated).
  - Gut permeability, endotoxin translocation, elevated IL-6/TNF-α/CRP.
  - Gut microbiome dysbiosis, reduced anti-inflammatory SCFAs.
  - Gut-liver-brain axis, neuroinflammation.
  - Sets up all subsequent chapters.
- **2. Heart Health & Blood Pressure** (`drafts/cardiovascular.md`)
  - Wood et al. HRs, BP reductions, AF RCT; myth box J-curve.
  - Inflammation (Chapter 1) as underlying driver.
- **3. Cancer Risk: The No-Safe-Floor Truth** (`drafts/cancer.md`)
  - Group 1 carcinogen, per-10 g/day RRs, heavy-use RRs, no safe floor.
  - Inflammation as part of carcinogenic pathway.
- **4. Dementia & Memory Loss** (`drafts/dementia.md`)
  - Hippocampal atrophy (Topiwala OR 3.4 at 14-21 units/week).
  - Dementia risk climbs with intake (Sabia 17% higher at >14 units/week).
  - Neuroinflammation, neurogenesis suppression.
  - Sick-quitter bias explained.
  - THE most terrifying outcome for 60+ audience.
- **5. Sleep: Why You Wake Up Exhausted** (`drafts/sleep.md`)
  - REM/SWS suppression, rebound wakefulness at 2-4 AM.
  - HRV reduction, cortisol surge.
  - Sleep myth box: "Alcohol helps me sleep."
  - Links to dementia (amyloid-beta clearance), inflammation, mental health, weight.
- **6. Falls, Balance & Fracture Risk** (`drafts/falls_balance.md`)
  - Acute dose-response ORs for injury; higher consequences in 60+.
  - Sleep deprivation + alcohol = compounded fall risk.
- **7. Dangerous Drug Interactions** (`drafts/med_interactions.md`)
  - Bleed/hypotension/hypoglycemia/sedation risks; guideline quotes.
- **8. Anxiety, Depression & The Rebound Trap** (`drafts/mental_health.md`)
  - AUD → depression ~2×; rebound anxiety; sleep disruption.
  - Connections to inflammation (Chapter 1), sleep (Chapter 5).
- **9. Liver & Digestive Health** (`drafts/liver_digestive.md`)
  - Fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis risk.
  - GERD, gastritis, malabsorption.
  - Gut-liver connection, nutrient deficiencies.
  - Compounding effect after 60.
- **10. Metabolism & Weight Gain** (`drafts/metabolism_weight.md`)
  - Weight gain mechanisms (7 cal/g, blocks fat oxidation, appetite dysregulation).
  - Sleep→cortisol→insulin resistance→visceral fat.
  - Visceral fat secreting inflammatory cytokines (ties to Chapter 1).
  - Compounding effect after 60.
  - Final evidence chapter before transition to solutions.

## Part III — (Later) The Sober Lit Life (Solutions/Program)
- To be drafted after evidence: movement, social scripts, nutrition/supplements, sleep hygiene, hobbies, spirituality, games, affirmations, 30/60/90 plan.

## Data gaps / nice-to-have tightenings
- Falls: hip-fracture-specific stat (optional) if desired.  
- Meds: add one bleed/hypo figure if needed (guideline quotes already in).  
- Mental health: add an anxiety-specific RR if desired.  
- Sleep: add one lab number on REM/SWS % reduction by dose if more precision needed.
