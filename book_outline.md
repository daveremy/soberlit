# Sober Lit: Thriving After 60 Without Alcohol — Working Outline

> Problem/evidence-first structure; solutions later.

## Part I — The Situation & Myths
- **Chapter: The Situation** (`drafts/situation.md`)  
  - Retired-life patterns, physiology shifts, polypharmacy, normalization.  
  - Crosswalk to harm areas.
- **Chapter: Myths vs Reality** (`drafts/myths_vs_reality.md`)  
  - Heart/J-curve, sleep, “just one glass,” relaxation, social, brain safety, meds, nightcap/injury.

## Part II — The Harms (Evidence Chapters)
- **Cardiovascular Health & BP** (`drafts/cardiovascular.md`)  
  - Wood et al. HRs, BP reductions, AF RCT; myth box J-curve.
- **Cancer Risk** (`drafts/cancer.md`)  
  - Group 1 carcinogen, per-10 g/day RRs, heavy-use RRs, no safe floor.
- **Brain, Dementia, Sleep** (`drafts/brain_sleep.md`)  
  - Hippocampal atrophy, dementia risk, REM/SWS fragmentation.
- **Falls & Balance** (`drafts/falls_balance.md`)  
  - Acute dose-response ORs for injury; higher consequences in 60+.
- **Medication Interactions** (`drafts/med_interactions.md`)  
  - Bleed/hypotension/hypoglycemia/sedation risks; guideline quotes.
- **Mental Health** (`drafts/mental_health.md`)  
  - AUD → depression ~2×; rebound anxiety; sleep disruption.

## Part III — (Later) The Sober Lit Life (Solutions/Program)
- To be drafted after evidence: movement, social scripts, nutrition/supplements, sleep hygiene, hobbies, spirituality, games, affirmations, 30/60/90 plan.

## Data gaps / nice-to-have tightenings
- Falls: hip-fracture-specific stat (optional) if desired.  
- Meds: add one bleed/hypo figure if needed (guideline quotes already in).  
- Mental health: add an anxiety-specific RR if desired.  
- Sleep: add one lab number on REM/SWS % reduction by dose if more precision needed.
