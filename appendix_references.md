## Cardiovascular & BP
- **[Wood2018]** Wood AM et al., Lancet 2018. Pooled cohort of 599,912 drinkers. Lowest risk ≤100 g/week (~7 drinks). Per +100 g/week: stroke HR 1.14, HF 1.09, fatal HTN 1.24, fatal aneurysm 1.15. Life expectancy hit up to ~4–5 years at >350 g/week (age 40 baseline). Shows harm rises above ~1 drink/day; no J-curve benefit for stroke/HTN/AF drivers.
- **[Roerecke2017]** Roerecke M et al., Lancet Public Health 2017. Meta-analysis of 36 trials. Cutting heavy intake (~6+ drinks/day) by ~50% lowers SBP ~−5.5 mmHg, DBP ~−4 mmHg; little change if already ≤2 drinks/day. Fast BP gains from reducing alcohol.
- **[Voskoboinik2020]** Voskoboinik A et al., NEJM 2020. RCT in AF patients (mean age 62). Abstinence: AF recurrence 53% vs 73% control; HR 0.55. Less time in AF. Concrete rhythm benefit from stopping.

## Cancer
- **[Bagnardi2015]** Bagnardi V et al., Br J Cancer 2015. Dose-response meta (572 studies). Per +10 g/day: breast ~1.05; colorectal (men) ~1.07; oral/pharynx ~1.17; esophageal SCC ~1.30. Heavy vs none: oral/pharynx 5.13; esophageal 4.95; colorectal 1.44; breast 1.61; liver 2.07, etc. No safe floor.
- **[WHO2023]** WHO Europe statement, 4 Jan 2023. “Risk starts from the first drop… the less you drink, the safer it is.” Alcohol = Group 1 carcinogen; no safe threshold.

## Brain, Cognition, Sleep
- **[Topiwala2017]** Topiwala A et al., BMJ 2017. Whitehall II imaging, mean mid-60s. “Moderate” 14–21 UK units/week OR 3.4 for hippocampal atrophy; >30 units/week OR 5.8; no protective effect of light intake. Moderate is not brain-safe.
- **[Sabia2018]** Sabia S et al., BMJ 2018. 23-year cohort. >14 units/week → ~17% higher dementia risk vs 1–14; abstinence HR 1.47 vs 1–14 (sick-quitter issue). Keep intake low or none.
- **[Roehrs1999]** Roehrs T et al., Neuropsychopharmacology 1999. 0.5 g/kg ethanol before bed reduced REM over 8 hours; insomniacs self-selected; shows REM suppression in humans.
- **[RoehrsRothReview]** Roehrs & Roth, Alcohol and sleep (review). Summarizes REM/SWS suppression, fragmentation, HRV hit with evening alcohol (~0.5–1.0 g/kg). Mechanism: early sedation, later rebound wake/REM loss.

## Falls & Fractures
- **[Taylor2010]** Taylor B et al., Drug Alcohol Depend 2010. Meta/case-crossover. Non-MVA injury OR 1.30 per +10 g alcohol on an occasion (~24 at 140 g); MVA OR 1.24 per +10 g (~52 at 120 g). Acute dose-response injury risk.
- **[Ke2023]** Ke Y et al., Adv Nutr 2023. Dose-response meta (44 studies; 6M participants). Highest vs lowest alcohol: total fracture RR 1.26; osteoporotic 1.24; hip 1.20. +6% total fracture risk per +14 g/day. Dose-related fracture risk.

## Medication Interactions
- **[NIAAAClinGuide]** NIAAA Clinician’s Guide. Alcohol can increase warfarin effect/bleeding; can cause hypoglycemia with insulin/sulfonylureas. Warns on sedation with CNS depressants.
- **[FDABoxed]** FDA boxed warnings / Beers Criteria. Combining opioids, benzos, sedative-hypnotics with alcohol may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, death. Avoid in older adults.

## Mental Health
- **[Boden2011]** Boden JM & Fergusson DM, Addiction 2011. Meta/review. AUD → major depression AOR ~2.0. Bidirectional, strongest path AUD→depression. Heavier use = higher risk.
- **[Lees2020]** Lees GM et al., Lancet Psychiatry 2020. Meta-analysis of common mental disorders and AUD. Anxiety/phobic disorder OR 1.94 (1.35–2.78) with AUD (comorbidity; supports bidirectional link).

## How to read these
- Check age bands; note when 60+ is explicit vs extrapolated.
- Prefer dose-response and absolute risk where available.
- Note biases: self-report, sick-quitter, confounding (smoking/SES/diet).
