- **[Lakhiani]** Lakhiani V. *The Buddha and the Badass*, Chapter 4. Mindvalley. Concept of becoming "unfuckwithable"—cultivating individualistic approach to life, indifference to others' judgment, unwavering inner balance. Applied here: building unassailable relationship with alcohol where external pressure or availability has zero influence.
- **[Manfredi2020]** Manfredi L. *Unfuckwithable: A Guide to Inspired Badassery*, 2020. Empowerment framework emphasizing authenticity (unapologetically yourself), inner balance (grounded despite external chaos), persistence (staying true to vision), self-control (controlling reactions vs. being controlled by emotions).

## Habit Formation & Behavior Change
- **[Lally2009]** Lally P et al., European Journal of Social Psychology 2010;40(6):998-1009 (published online 2009). "How are habits formed: Modelling habit formation in the real world." Average 66 days to reach automaticity (range 18–254 days); missing occasional opportunities doesn't derail habit formation; simple behaviors automate faster than complex ones.
- **[Duhigg2012]** Duhigg C. *The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business*, Random House 2012. Popularized the Habit Loop (Cue-Routine-Reward); Golden Rule of habit change: keep cue and reward, replace routine. Explains neurological patterns governing habits and how to modify them.
- **[Fogg2020]** Fogg BJ. *Tiny Habits: The Small Changes That Change Everything*, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt 2020. Behavior Model: B=MAP (Behavior happens when Motivation, Ability, and Prompt converge). Make new behaviors tiny/easy; anchor to existing routines; celebrate small wins.

- **[Gollwitzer1999]** Gollwitzer PM, American Psychologist 1999;54(7):493-503. "Implementation intentions: Strong effects of simple plans." If-then planning creates medium-large effect (d=.65) on goal attainment. Pre-specifying when/where/how to act delegates control to situational cues, automating goal-directed responses.
- **[HALT]** HALT (Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired) framework. Origin: Addiction recovery community (AA and related programs); no single inventor; evolved organically from clinical practice. Simple trigger-identification tool to recognize when urges stem from basic unmet needs rather than true desire for substance. Modern clinical applications extend beyond addiction to general stress management.

## Sleep & Circadian Health
- **[Walker2017]** Walker M. *Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams*, Scribner 2017. Comprehensive review of sleep science. Key findings: alcohol suppresses REM sleep (critical for memory/emotion regulation), fragments sleep architecture, causes rebound wakefulness. Sedation ≠ sleep. Also covers sleep hygiene: consistent schedule, cool bedroom (~65°F), dim lights/no screens before bed, avoid caffeine after 1pm, never go to bed tipsy.

## Flow & Optimal Experience
- **[Csikszentmihalyi1990]** Csikszentmihalyi M. *Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience*, Harper & Row 1990. Foundational work in positive psychology. Flow state = total absorption in challenging activity matched to skill level; characterized by deep enjoyment, creativity, time distortion. Happiness is developable by structuring activities to produce flow. Boredom antidote: making/learning vs. passive consumption.

## Neuroscience & Brain Recovery
- **[Thuret2015]** Thuret S. "You can grow new brain cells. Here's how." TED Talk, 2015. Neuroscientist at King's College London. Research on adult neurogenesis in hippocampus: adults can grow new neurons throughout life. Factors that promote neurogenesis: learning, exercise, omega-3s, flavonoids, intermittent fasting. Factors that inhibit: stress, sleep deprivation, aging, alcohol. Applied here: alcohol suppresses neurogenesis; cutting it restores brain's capacity for learning and memory formation.
- **[Porges2011]** Porges SW. *The Polyvagal Theory: Neurophysiological Foundations of Emotions, Attachment, Communication, Self-Regulation*, W.W. Norton 2011. Describes autonomic nervous system as phylogenetically adaptive: vagus nerve regulates stress responses, social engagement, and homeostasis. Higher vagal tone (measured via respiratory sinus arrhythmia/RSA) correlates with better stress regulation and social connection. Safe environments increase vagal tone; threat decreases it. Applied here: physical state-shifting (walk, cold water, breathing) can modulate vagal tone and interrupt urge cycles.
- **[DopamineRecovery]** NIAAA "Neuroscience: The Brain in Addiction and Recovery"; multiple sources on dopamine reset timelines. Alcohol disrupts dopamine transmission in nucleus accumbens (reward center). Recovery timeline: initial restoration begins within weeks; most people return to baseline dopamine function around 90 days; full striatal D2 receptor and dopamine transporter (DAT) recovery can take 4–14 months. Boredom in early sobriety = dopamine recalibration; natural rewards (conversation, learning, movement) gradually feel engaging again as brain heals.

## Relationships & Connection
- **[Gottman]** Gottman JM & Gottman JS. The Gottman Institute research on relationships (40+ years of marriage studies). Key concepts: (1) Love Maps = detailed knowledge of partner's inner world; (2) Repair Attempts = efforts during conflict to de-escalate tension (humor, affection, acknowledgment); successful repairs predict relationship stability; (3) Four Horsemen = relationship killers (criticism, contempt, defensiveness, stonewalling). Applied here: alcohol-free presence improves repair capacity and emotional attunement; sobriety enables deeper Love Maps and authentic connection.

## Nutrition & Physiology
- **[ProtAge2013]** Bauer J et al., J Am Med Dir Assoc 2013. PROT-AGE Study Group evidence-based protein recommendations for older adults to prevent/treat sarcopenia: healthy older adults need 1.0–1.2 g protein/kg/day (higher than RDA 0.8 g/kg); acute/chronic illness 1.2–1.5 g/kg; severe illness up to 2.0 g/kg. Distribute evenly across meals (25–30g/meal); prioritize high-quality protein with adequate leucine. Combine with resistance exercise for optimal benefit.
- **[CreatineMeta2023]** Avgerinos KI et al., Nutrition Reviews 2023;81(4):416-427. Meta-analysis of creatine supplementation and memory in healthy individuals. Creatine enhanced memory performance, especially in older adults (66–76 years). Mechanism: creatine supports ATP regeneration in brain tissue, particularly under metabolic stress. Typical dose: 3–5 g/day. Emerging evidence for cognitive benefits in aging; well-established for muscle mass/strength when combined with resistance training.

## Breathing & Autonomic Regulation
- **[LehrerGevirtz2014]** Lehrer PM & Gevirtz R, Frontiers in Psychology 2014;5:756. "Heart rate variability biofeedback: how and why does it work?" Resonance frequency breathing (4.5–6.5 breaths/min, ~0.075–0.11 Hz) maximizes respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and heart rate variability (HRV). Mechanism: strengthens baroreceptor homeostasis, increases baroreflex gain. Efficacy demonstrated for anxiety, depression, PTSD, hypertension, chronic pain, insomnia, performance. Applied here: slow-paced breathing (4–6 breaths/min) in wind-down routine modulates autonomic tone, aids sleep onset, and interrupts stress/urge cycles.

## How to read these
- Check age bands; note when 60+ is explicit vs extrapolated.
- Prefer dose-response and absolute risk where available.
- Note biases: self-report, sick-quitter, confounding (smoking/SES/diet).
