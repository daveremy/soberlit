# Sober Lit - Style Guide

> Reference document for maintaining consistency across the book

---

## Core Positioning

**This book is:**
- A knowledge base for informed choice about alcohol after 60
- About successful aging optimization (not recovery or sobriety struggle)
- Research-backed, evidence-driven, age-specific
- Written for health-conscious adults 60+, likely retired
- Personal (author's lived experience) but not prescriptive

**This book is NOT:**
- A recovery program or clinical treatment guide
- A formulaic "sober lit" book with worksheets and case studies
- A wellness book that glosses over risks or promotes moderation
- Instructional or preachy

---

## Voice & Tone

### Voice
- **"We" not "you"** - We're in this together, not instructor/student
  - ✅ "We've earned the freedom of retirement"
  - ❌ "You've earned the freedom of retirement"
- **First person when sharing lived experience** - "I'm writing this for me"
- **Direct without being preachy** - State facts, trust reader intelligence
- **Conversational but not casual** - Readable like Morgan Housel, not academic

### Tone
- **Factual and evidence-driven** - Let the data speak
- **Hard-hitting but not fear-mongering** - Research is damning enough
- **Conviction-based, not deprivation-based** - Choosing from strength
- **Supportive without coddling** - Readers are intelligent adults
- **No marketing hype** - Avoid "The Lie vs The Truth" framing

---

## Style & Punctuation

### Punctuation Rules
- **Default to commas** for pauses and clauses
- **Use em-dashes sparingly** - Only for exceptional emphasis or interruption
- **Avoid over-punctuating** - Prefer shorter sentences when possible
- **Bold for emphasis** - Key concepts, important takeaways
- **Italics for nuance** - Subtle emphasis, technical terms on first use

### Formatting
- **No emoji** (unless explicitly requested by author)
- **Section headers clear and descriptive**
- **Bullet points for lists** - Readable, scannable
- **Code blocks for specific examples** (if needed)

## Content Guidelines

### What to Include

**Research & Evidence:**
- Cite specific studies with inline [Tag] format
- Include effect sizes, confidence intervals, sample sizes when relevant
- Age-specific data (60+ focus)
- Make research readable, not academic

**Frameworks & Tools:**
- Explain conceptually, not prescriptively
- HALT, trigger swaps, implementation intentions, etc.
- Show the "why" behind the "how"
- Tools for building conviction + strategy

**Personal Experience:**
- Author's 30/60/90 journey as **example, not template**
- Real triggers, real struggles, real wins
- "This is what I'm doing" not "this is what you should do"

**Successful Aging Frame:**
- Vision for 60s/70s/80s being the best years
- Maintaining goals, energy, clarity, presence
- Independence, contribution, connection
- Autumn of life metaphor

### What to Avoid

**Formulaic Sober Lit:**
- ❌ Case study boxes ("Meet Bob, 68...")
- ❌ Fill-in worksheets and templates
- ❌ Prescriptive 12-step style plans
- ❌ Recovery language (relapse, sobriety-as-struggle)
- ❌ Support group framing

**Marketing Hype:**
- ❌ "The Lie" vs "The Truth" structures
- ❌ Over-the-top validation or praise
- ❌ Superlatives and exaggeration
- ❌ Emotional manipulation

**Other:**
- ❌ Defensive positioning ("What makes this different")
- ❌ Lists of "how to use this book"
- ❌ Talking down to readers
- ❌ Vague wellness advice

## Key Concepts & Terms

### "Unfuckwithable"
- Source: Vishen Lakhiani, Lindsay Manfredi
- Definition: Unassailable relationship with alcohol where external pressure, availability, social norms have zero power
- **Not just conviction** - conviction + framework + strategy
- Not avoidance or willpower, but clarity and preparation

### "Sober Lit" (Double Meaning)
1. **Sober Literature** - Evidence-based information
2. **Sober = Lit** - Operating at higher frequency (energy, joy, presence, aliveness)

### "Dead Weight Disguised as Support"
- Core metaphor for alcohol
- Heavy vest while swimming through best years
- Promises help, delivers harm

### "Successful Aging"
- Source: Rowe & Kahn (1997)
- Three pillars: low disease risk, high cognitive/physical function, engagement with life
- Alcohol incompatible with this vision

## Structure & Organization

### Book Parts
- **Part I:** Situation & Myths
- **Part II:** Evidence (research-focused, readable, age-specific)
- **Part III:** Solutions (frameworks, not prescriptions)

### Chapter Flow
- **Evidence chapters:** Research + Successful Aging Angle + Transition to next chapter
- **Solution chapters:** Framework explanation + application (not worksheets)
- **Transitions:** 2-3 paragraph bridges between chapters

### For AI/Digital Adaptation
- Modular structure (knowledge base, not linear prescription)
- User journals lived experience
- AI applies frameworks to user's specific context
- No pre-made templates, just conversation and pattern recognition

---

## Reference Style

### Inline Citations
- Format: `[Tag]` or `[Tag: specific detail]`
- Example: `[Wood2018]` or `[Topiwala2017: OR 3.4 for hippocampal atrophy]`

### Key References to Include
- **Huberman Labs podcast on alcohol** - The eye-opener (add full citation)
- All research studies cited in evidence chapters
- Behavioral science frameworks (Duhigg, Fogg, Gollwitzer, etc.)
- Successful aging literature (Rowe & Kahn, Baltes)

### Appendix
- Annotated references (readable, not just citation lists)
- Full GitHub trail for deep dives

---

## Writing Model

**Think: Morgan Housel**
- Short, focused chapters (one idea per chapter)
- Real principles through clear examples
- Conversational but never dumbed down
- Research-backed without being academic
- Stories that illustrate, not fabricate

**Not:**
- Academic papers (too dense)
- Recovery memoirs (too personal/crisis-focused)
- Self-help books (too prescriptive/formulaic)

---

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing any section, ask:

1. **Is this factual and research-backed?** (No hype, no exaggeration)
2. **Does this trust reader intelligence?** (Not talking down)
3. **Is this "we" voice, not "you"?** (Together, not instructor/student)
4. **Does this build conviction, not fear?** (Data-driven clarity)
5. **Is this specific to 60+?** (Age-relevant physiology, risks, goals)
6. **Does this support successful aging vision?** (Optimization, not decline)
7. **Would Morgan Housel write it this way?** (Readable, smart, evidence-based)

## Examples

### Good Opening
✅ "The World Health Organization released a statement in 2023 that didn't get the attention it deserved: 'When it comes to alcohol consumption, there is no safe amount that does not affect health.'"

**Why it works:** Direct, factual, immediately establishes stakes

### Bad Opening
❌ "It's 5:47 PM on a Tuesday. You've been retired for eight months now..."

**Why it fails:** Recovery-book scene, talks AT reader, prescriptive

### Good Evidence Statement
✅ "Alcohol shrinks your brain. Two glasses of wine most nights (14-21 units/week) causes hippocampal atrophy, your memory center physically shrinks (Topiwala 2017, OR 3.4)."

**Why it works:** Hard fact, specific data, no spin

### Bad Evidence Statement
❌ "The Lie: A couple glasses of wine won't hurt. The Truth: Your brain is shrinking!"

**Why it fails:** Marketing hype, dramatic framing, talks down to reader
