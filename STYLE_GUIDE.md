# Style Guide: Sober Lit — The Integrated Man

> **Target Audience:** Men over 60. Retired or semi-retired. Likely professional/technical backgrounds. Systems thinkers. Skeptical of "wellness" fluff.
> **Core Identity:** "The Integrated Man" (The Architect).
> **Tone:** Direct, Systems-Oriented, Dry Humor, Stoic, "Man-to-Man."

## 1. The Voice: "The Skeptical Optimist"

We are not a guru on a mountaintop. We are a fellow traveler who checked the data, ran the numbers, and realized we were running a faulty operating system.

**Key Attributes:**
*   **Direct & Data-Driven:** "Here is the mechanism of action." (Like Peter Attia).
*   **Systems-Based:** Use metaphors of engineering, architecture, and software. "Debug the code," "Architect the environment," "Upgrade the OS."
*   **Stoic but Human:** We accept mortality and reality, but we laugh at the absurdity of it.
*   **Humorous:** Use dry wit to deflate tension. Puncture the pretension of the "wine lifestyle."

**Writers to Channel:**
*   **Steven Pressfield:** For the call to discipline and the battle against "Resistance."
*   **Dan Harris:** For the skepticism and practicality.
*   **Bill Bryson:** For the observational humor about aging.
*   **Morgan Housel:** For the punchy, logical clarity.

## 2. Humor Guidelines

*   **Self-Deprecation > Judgment:** Poke fun at *our own* past behaviors (the 3 AM wake-ups, the "wine connoisseur" delusions) rather than judging the reader.
*   **The Absurdity of Aging:** It's okay to laugh at the fact that we now get excited about a good night's sleep or a comfortable chair.
*   **Dry Wit:** "Alcohol is a loan shark that charges 400% interest on happiness."

## 3. Terminology & Identity

*   **YES:** Integrated Man, Architect, Systems, Capacity, Relevance, Competence, Agency, Dad/Grandpa (Patriarch role).
*   **NO:** Elder (unless "Modern Elder" in specific Chip Conley context), Senior (too medical), Journey (too woo-woo), Sobriety (too recovery-focused—use "Alcohol-Free" or "Freedom"), Alcoholic (we don't use labels).

## 4. The Male Pivot (Specific Themes)

Every chapter must pass the "Why does a 65-year-old man care?" test.

*   **Instead of "Health," say "Capacity."** Men want to *do* things (hike, build, travel, have sex).
*   **Instead of "Feelings," say "Regulation."** Men want control over their state.
*   **Instead of "Friendship," say "Allies/Crew."** Men bond shoulder-to-shoulder (activities), not face-to-face (talking).
*   **Highlight the "Void":** Directly address the loss of the "Provider/Producer" identity.

## 5. Formatting

*   **Short Paragraphs:** Keep the pace moving.
*   **Bold for Emphasis:** Skimmable logic.
*   **"We" Voice:** Solidarity. "We know the clock is ticking."

## 6. The "Unfuckwithable" Definition

Contextualize as **"Unassailable Conviction."** It's not aggression; it's the calm certainty of a man who knows his own mind and cannot be swayed by social pressure or marketing.

## 7. Science + Inspiration (No Workbooks)

*   **Science + Systems First:** Anchor claims in mechanisms, late-life research, and systems thinking. When we mention practices, we explain *why* they help (in terms of capacity, agency, or meaning), not just that they are "good for you."
*   **Inspiration from Real Thinkers:** Weave in observations from Stoics, contemplatives, and modern thinkers (e.g., Marcus Aurelius, Buddha, Ram Dass, Housel, Inner Excellence, Huberman/Patrick) as touchstones, not as quote dumps or guru talk.
*   **Influencers as Consultants, Not Drivers:** Elias stays the synthesizer. Influencers (Attia, Huberman, Patrick, Inner Excellence/Pressfield, Housel, Waldinger, Frankl, Ram Dass, Thich Nhat Hanh, Clear/Fogg/Newport, etc.) are brought in for specific mechanisms or frames and then translated back into the Integrated Man system. Avoid laundry‑lists of names; each citation must visibly earn its place.
*   **Domain‑Anchored References:** It is fine to have multiple aligned thinkers in the book overall, but each chapter should lean on a small set of anchors per domain (e.g., Attia/Huberman/Patrick for late‑life capacity, Inner Excellence/Pressfield for competitive mindset and chosen adversity, Housel for “enough” and money, Waldinger for relationships, Frankl/Ram Dass/Thich Nhat Hanh for mortality and meaning, Clear/Fogg/Newport for behavior architecture and environment).
*   **Execution Chapters: Elias First:** In Part V (30/60/90 and Long Game), prioritize a clean Elias voice with minimal referencing; use earlier parts and appendices for most explicit citations so the execution plan reads as a coherent, lived system rather than a tour of sources.
*   **Guidance > Homework:** The book is a manual, not a workbook. Default is narrative observations and advice with light examples of "how this often looks," not long checklists or fill‑in‑the‑blank exercises. When we do offer a concrete exercise, it should feel optional and clearly tied to the larger argument.
*   **No One-Right-Protocol Tone:** We describe patterns that tend to work for men like the reader, and offer options. We avoid prescriptive 10‑step plans unless absolutely necessary (e.g., medical safety).
