# Audit 11: Performance (Sexual Function)

> **The Mechanism:** Endocrine Disruption & Vasoconstriction
> **The Cost:** Your Virility

We’ve arrived at the chapter most men skip but worry about the most.
**Erectile Dysfunction (ED).**
**Low Libido.**
**Testosterone.**

We have been sold a lie: "Liquid Courage." The idea that a few drinks make you a better lover.
The reality: **Alcohol is chemical castration.**

## The Plumbing: Hydraulics Again

An erection is a hydraulic event. It requires:
1.  Blood flow (Vasodilation).
2.  Nerve sensitivity.
3.  Hormonal signal (Testosterone).

Alcohol attacks all three.
1.  **Vascular:** Chronic alcohol damages the endothelium (lining of blood vessels). It creates micro-vascular damage. If blood can't get there, the hydraulic lift doesn't happen.
2.  **Nerve:** Alcohol causes peripheral neuropathy. It numbs sensation.
3.  **Hormonal:** (See below).

**The "Whiskey D**k" isn't a joke.** It is a sign of acute system failure.

## The Hormone Hit: Tanking Your T

We talked about Aromatase in the last chapter (belly fat turning T into Estrogen).
But alcohol also attacks the **Testes** directly. It lowers testosterone production at the source.

If you are over 60, you are already fighting a natural decline in T.
Why would you voluntarily accelerate it?

Low T means:
*   Low libido.
*   Muscle loss.
*   Depression.
*   Fatigue.

## The Performance Paradox

"But I feel more aroused when I drink!"
That’s the **Disinhibition** (brain) talking.
Your brain says "Go." Your body says "No."

This creates performance anxiety. Which leads to more drinking to calm the nerves. Which leads to worse performance.
It is a death spiral for your sex life.

## The Integrated Man Angle: Virility

Virility isn't just about sex. It’s about **Vitality**. The energy to pursue life.

When you quit drinking:
*   Testosterone often rebounds.
*   Blood flow improves (everywhere).
*   Sensitivity returns.

You want to be a lover, not a sleepy observer.
Put down the drink. Pick up the weights. Fix the blood flow.
