# Solutions / Sober Lit Life (Outline)

> High-level plan; fill with details later. Keep tone supportive/coach-like.

## Principles
- Evidence-first: you’ve seen the costs; this is the “what to do instead.”
- Unassailable (“unfuckwithable”) stance: we’re not avoiding alcohol out of fear; we see it offers zero upside. Even if it’s around and no one is looking, we choose not to drink because we meet the real need directly.
- Root-cause check (HALT+Thirst/Stress): any urge points to hunger/anger/lonely/tired/thirst/stress—solve that, not with alcohol.
- Replace, don’t just remove: social scripts, rituals, movement, rest, learning.
- Trackable and modular: start where you are; stack wins.

## Sections to include
- **Mindset & identity:** reframing (sober lit), affirmations/mantras; how to use them (recordings, morning/evening practice).
- **Vision & goals (successful aging):** define what “lit” looks like for the next decades (health, connection, contribution); keep goals after retirement; end-of-life clarity; see `drafts/solutions_vision_goals.md`.
- **Social & scripts:** how to decline gracefully; host/guest strategies; building sober-friendly social plans; leveraging NA options; handling peer pressure.
- **Movement & physicality (for non-athletes):** strength 2–3x/week, balance, walking volume; entry-level plans; joint-friendly options.
- **Nutrition & supplements:** protein targets; creatine; omega-3; vitamin D; B1; caution on meds/conditions—“talk to your clinician.” See `drafts/solutions_nutrition.md`.
- **Hydration (as a pillar):** daily targets (e.g., 2–3 L/day adjusted for size/activity/heat), electrolytes when sweating or low-carb, front-load earlier in day to protect sleep; note that dehydration can masquerade as craving/low mood.
- **Substitutes (situational replacements):** map triggers and pair a swap:
  - “Treat” trigger → food treat (fruit, ice cream, dark chocolate) or ritual drink (tea, NA spritz).
  - “Stress” trigger → breath set/walk/stretch + cold/warm drink.
  - “Social” trigger → NA craft/bitters + citrus; scripts to hold a glass without alcohol.
  - “Boredom” trigger → quick hobby/game/read block; sensory swap (sparkling water with citrus).
  - See: `drafts/solutions_hydration_substitutes.md` for a full section.
- **Sleep you can trust:** consistent schedule; light, temperature, wind-down; caffeine/alcohol-free evening ritual; nightcap swaps; hydration timing to avoid wake-ups. See `drafts/solutions_sleep_ritual.md`.
- **Social scripts:** prepared declines, host/guest tactics, NA orders, anchor drinks; see `drafts/solutions_social_scripts.md`.
- **Movement starter (non-athletes):** walking, strength 2–3x/week, balance daily; safety/cautions; see `drafts/solutions_movement.md`.
- **Hobbies/games/learning:** structured boredom-killers—book clubs, games, courses, volunteering, making/learning streaks. See `drafts/solutions_hobbies.md`.
- **Spirituality/mindfulness:** practices that fit (prayer, meditation, nature, gratitude). See `drafts/solutions_spirituality.md`.
- **Relationships:** showing up sober; repairing strain; grandparenting presence; communication without alcohol. See `drafts/solutions_relationships.md`.
- **Digital/trackers:** optional tools for sleep, steps, mood; journaling templates.
- **30/60/90-day plan:** phased build: remove alcohol, add replacements, stack movement/social, review metrics. Include relapse plan. See `drafts/solutions_30_60_90.md`.
- **Maintenance:** monthly reflections; updating affirmations; community; handling slips.

## Mindset/trigger strategy
- Use a quick check (HALT/needs scan): Hunger, Anger, Lonely, Tired (add Stress/Thirst as needed). Assume the “need” isn’t alcohol; treat the root (eat, hydrate, move, connect, rest).
- Pair each trigger with a predefined swap (above) to reduce friction.

## Artifacts to create
- Affirmations/mantras list + note on recording/playback.
- Social scripts cheat sheet.
- Movement starter plan (strength/balance/walk).
- Evening ritual template (alcohol-free).
- 30/60/90 calendar/checklist.

## Reminders
- Keep references where claims are made (e.g., creatine safety, protein targets).
- Keep tone: “You can do this; here’s how,” not prescriptive.
