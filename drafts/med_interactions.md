# Audit 7: Chemical Warfare (Medications)

> **The Mechanism:** Pharmacokinetic Interaction
> **The Cost:** System Failure

You are likely running a complex chemical operation.
Statins. Blood pressure meds. Maybe a blood thinner. Maybe something for sleep.

This is modern medicine keeping the machine running. It’s engineering.

When you pour alcohol into that system, you are introducing a **chaos agent**.

## The Liver Bottleneck

Your liver processes drugs. It also processes alcohol.
When both are present, the liver prioritizes the alcohol (because it’s a toxin).

What happens to the meds?
1.  **They stack up:** The drugs stay in your system longer, leading to overdose effects.
2.  **They fail:** Or the liver processes them too fast (enzyme induction), and they stop working.

## The Specific Threats for Men

*   **Blood Thinners (Warfarin, Eliquis):** Alcohol increases bleeding risk. One drink can turn a minor cut into a major event. Or a minor bump on the head into a brain bleed (NIAAA).
*   **Blood Pressure Meds:** Alcohol + BP meds = Hypotension (blood pressure crash). You stand up, you pass out. (See: Falls).
*   **Pain Meds (Tylenol/NSAIDs):** Alcohol + Tylenol = Liver destruction. Alcohol + Aspirin = Stomach bleeding.
*   **Viagra/Cialis:** Alcohol counteracts them. (We’ll get to that in the Performance chapter).

## The Integrated Man Angle: Systems Logic

You are a systems thinker.
You wouldn't pour sand into a finely tuned engine.
You wouldn't run conflicting software codes on a critical server.

Why are you running conflicting chemicals in your own bloodstream?

Alcohol makes your medication dangerous or useless. It turns "health management" into "chemical roulette."

If you are taking meds to stay alive, don't drink a poison that fights them.
