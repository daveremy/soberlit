# Medication Interactions (Polypharmacy in 60+)

> Problem framing; solutions later.

After 60, many people take multiple meds for BP, heart rhythm, diabetes, pain, mood, or sleep. Alcohol stacks risk with these drugs—raising bleeding, crashing BP, triggering hypoglycemia, and deepening sedation/respiratory depression. Polypharmacy plus alcohol is a hidden accelerator of ER visits.

## Key points
- **Bleeding:** Alcohol + warfarin/DOACs/aspirin/NSAIDs → higher bleed risk (NIAAA: “increase the effect of warfarin and raise the risk of bleeding” [NIAAAClinGuide]).
- **Blood pressure:** Additive hypotension with antihypertensives; dizziness/fall risk.
- **Glucose:** Hypoglycemia risk rises with insulin/sulfonylureas when drinking (NIAAA caution [NIAAAClinGuide]).
- **Sedation/respiratory depression:** Alcohol + benzos, opioids, sleep aids (Z-drugs) deepen sedation and can depress breathing (FDA/Beers: “profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, death” [FDABoxed]/Beers).
- **Adherence/efficacy:** Alcohol disrupts med timing and absorption, reducing control of chronic conditions.

## Takeaways (scan)
- Alcohol is unsafe with common sedatives and opioids—breathing risk.
- Bleed, hypotension, and hypoglycemia risks climb with typical senior meds.
- In polypharmacy, “a few drinks” can unbalance multiple systems at once.
