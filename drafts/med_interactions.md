# Medication Interactions (Polypharmacy in 60+)

> Problem framing; solutions later.

After 60, many people take multiple meds for BP, heart rhythm, diabetes, pain, mood, or sleep. Alcohol stacks risk with these drugs—raising bleeding, crashing BP, triggering hypoglycemia, and deepening sedation/respiratory depression. Polypharmacy plus alcohol is a hidden accelerator of ER visits.

## Key points
- **Bleeding:** Alcohol + warfarin/DOACs/aspirin/NSAIDs → higher bleed risk (NIAAA: “increase the effect of warfarin and raise the risk of bleeding” [NIAAAClinGuide]).
- **Blood pressure:** Additive hypotension with antihypertensives; dizziness/fall risk.
- **Glucose:** Hypoglycemia risk rises with insulin/sulfonylureas when drinking (NIAAA caution [NIAAAClinGuide]).
- **Sedation/respiratory depression:** Alcohol + benzos, opioids, sleep aids (Z-drugs) deepen sedation and can depress breathing (FDA/Beers: “profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, death” [FDABoxed]/Beers).
- **Adherence/efficacy:** Alcohol disrupts med timing and absorption, reducing control of chronic conditions.

## Takeaways (scan)
- Alcohol is unsafe with common sedatives and opioids—breathing risk.
- Bleed, hypotension, and hypoglycemia risks climb with typical senior meds.
- In polypharmacy, "a few drinks" can unbalance multiple systems at once.

## Transition: From Medication Interactions to Mental Health

We've covered the physical dangers—bleeding, low blood pressure, dangerous sedation, hypoglycemia. These are measurable, concrete risks that show up in blood tests, ER visits, and hospital admissions. They're scary because they're immediate and visible.

But there's one more piece of the harm puzzle that's often overlooked, especially in older adults: **mental health**. The anxiety, the low mood, the "morning dread" that so many people chalk up to aging or life stress or genetics—when in reality, it's often the alcohol itself creating and amplifying these symptoms.

Because here's the brutal irony: the very thing people use to "relax" or "take the edge off" is the thing that's **causing** the anxiety and depression they're trying to escape. Alcohol is a short-acting sedative with a longer, harder rebound. And that rebound doesn't just affect your sleep—it directly impacts your mood, your anxiety levels, and your mental resilience.

Let's talk about the anxiety-depression trap and why cutting alcohol might be the most powerful mental health intervention you never knew you needed.
