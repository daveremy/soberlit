# Liver & Digestive Health

Alcohol affects our entire digestive system, from the moment it enters our mouths to the moment our livers finish processing it. And after 60, when digestive function and liver metabolism naturally slow, the impact compounds.

This chapter covers two interconnected systems: the liver (our body's primary detoxification organ) and the digestive tract (where alcohol causes immediate damage and long-term dysfunction).

## Our Liver: Function and Impairment

Our livers do over 500 jobs: detoxifying chemicals, producing bile for digestion, storing vitamins and minerals, regulating blood sugar, producing proteins for blood clotting, and metabolizing alcohol.

When we drink regularly, alcohol becomes the liver's priority. Everything else gets delayed or disrupted.

### Fatty Liver Disease (Hepatic Steatosis)

Alcohol metabolism produces acetaldehyde, a toxic compound that damages liver cells. The liver responds by storing fat as a protective measure. This is fatty liver disease.

In the early stages, it's reversible. Stop drinking, and the fat clears within weeks to months.

But if we keep drinking, fat accumulation progresses. Liver cells become inflamed and swollen. This is alcoholic steatohepatitis.

**How common is this?** More common than most people realize. Regular drinking (even "moderate" levels by cultural standards) can cause fatty liver. After 60, when liver metabolism is already slower, the threshold for damage is lower.

We won't feel it. Fatty liver is usually asymptomatic until it's advanced. We might feel tired, have vague upper-right abdominal discomfort, but most people have no symptoms at all.

Blood tests (elevated liver enzymes: ALT, AST, GGT) can catch it. Imaging (ultrasound, CT, MRI) confirms it. But many people don't get tested until something else (routine physical, unrelated scan) reveals it.

### Alcoholic Hepatitis

If fatty liver progresses, inflammation worsens. Liver cells start dying. This is alcoholic hepatitis.

Symptoms:
- Jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes)
- Abdominal pain and swelling (ascites, fluid accumulation)
- Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite
- Fever
- Fatigue and weakness

Alcoholic hepatitis can be life-threatening. Severe cases have a mortality rate of 20-50% even with treatment. The only effective treatment is stopping alcohol immediately and providing supportive care.

### Cirrhosis: Irreversible Scarring

If we keep drinking through hepatitis, liver cells die and are replaced with scar tissue (fibrosis). Eventually, so much of the liver is scarred that it can't function. This is cirrhosis.

Cirrhosis is irreversible. The liver can't regenerate scar tissue back into functional liver cells. Once we have cirrhosis, the damage is permanent.

Complications of cirrhosis:
- Portal hypertension (increased pressure in the liver's blood vessels) → variceal bleeding (life-threatening internal bleeding)
- Hepatic encephalopathy (toxins accumulate in the brain, causing confusion, personality changes, coma)
- Liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma)
- Liver failure (the liver stops functioning, death follows without transplant)

Cirrhosis used to be considered a "late-stage alcoholic" disease, something that happened after decades of heavy drinking. But research suggests regular "moderate" drinking over years, especially after 60, may progress to cirrhosis faster than expected.

The liver's capacity to metabolize alcohol declines with age. What our livers handled fine at 40 might overwhelm them at 70.

## Digestive Dysfunction: GERD, Gastritis, and Malabsorption

Alcohol doesn't just damage the liver. It damages the entire digestive tract.

### GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease)

Alcohol relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), the muscle that keeps stomach acid in our stomachs. When the LES relaxes, acid flows back up into the esophagus.

This is GERD. We feel it as heartburn, burning in the chest, sour taste in the mouth, difficulty swallowing.

Chronic GERD increases risk of Barrett's esophagus (precancerous changes in the esophageal lining) and esophageal cancer.

After 60, GERD is more common even without alcohol (weaker LES, slower stomach emptying). Adding alcohol makes it worse.

### Gastritis (Stomach Lining Inflammation)

Alcohol irritates the stomach lining, causing inflammation (gastritis). Symptoms: nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, bloating, loss of appetite.

Chronic gastritis can lead to stomach ulcers, bleeding, and increased risk of stomach cancer.

### Malabsorption

Alcohol damages the small intestine's lining, where nutrient absorption happens. Over time, this leads to malabsorption: our bodies can't absorb vitamins (especially B vitamins, vitamin D, folate), minerals (iron, calcium, magnesium), and other nutrients from food.

Malabsorption causes:
- Fatigue and weakness (anemia from iron/B12 deficiency)
- Bone loss (calcium and vitamin D deficiency)
- Neuropathy (B vitamin deficiency)
- Cognitive decline (B12 deficiency can mimic dementia symptoms)

After 60, nutrient absorption is already declining. Adding alcohol-induced malabsorption on top of age-related changes may accelerate deficiency diseases.

We might be eating a healthy diet, but if our guts can't absorb the nutrients, it doesn't matter.

## The Compounding Effect After 60

Liver and digestive damage aren't separate problems. They reinforce each other.

- **Alcohol → fatty liver → inflammation → worsens gut permeability**
- **Malabsorption → nutrient deficiencies → fatigue → liver function declines**
- **GERD/gastritis → discomfort → poor food choices → liver stress**

And after 60, all of this happens faster:
- Liver metabolism is slower (alcohol clears more slowly, more time for damage)
- Digestive function is already declining (age-related changes + alcohol = worse malabsorption)
- Inflammation is already elevated (inflammaging + alcohol = severe chronic inflammation)

---

## The Successful Aging Angle

Liver function and digestive health are foundational to everything else. We can't have energy without a functioning liver. We can't absorb nutrients without a healthy gut. We can't maintain immune function, cognitive clarity, or physical vitality with chronic malabsorption and liver damage.

Alcohol impairs both:
- Liver: fat accumulation, hepatitis, cirrhosis risk
- Gut: GERD, gastritis, malabsorption, microbiome disruption

And these aren't abstract, long-term risks. These are immediate, measurable consequences.

The heartburn we're taking Prilosec for? That's alcohol relaxing our lower esophageal sphincters.

The fatigue despite eating well? That may be malabsorption from alcohol-damaged gut lining.

The elevated liver enzymes our doctors mentioned? That could be fatty liver from regular drinking.

All of it is connected. All of it may be driven by alcohol. Much of it is reversible.

Stop drinking, and within weeks:
- Fatty liver starts clearing (imaging shows fat reduction)
- GERD improves (LES function normalizes)
- Gut lining heals (nutrient absorption improves)
- Inflammation drops (less gut permeability)

This isn't theory. This is what research suggests happens when we remove the toxin and let our bodies heal.

## Key takeaways (scan)

- Liver processes alcohol as priority, delays/disrupts everything else
- Fatty liver (hepatic steatosis) common even at "moderate" intake, reversible if caught early
- Alcoholic hepatitis (inflamed liver, cell death) can be life-threatening
- Cirrhosis (irreversible scarring) risk may increase with regular drinking, potentially faster after 60
- GERD (acid reflux) worsens with alcohol (relaxes LES)
- Gastritis (stomach lining inflammation) → ulcers, bleeding, cancer risk
- Malabsorption (damaged small intestine) → vitamin/mineral deficiencies, anemia, bone loss, neuropathy
- After 60: slower liver metabolism, worse malabsorption, higher inflammation
- Much of this may be reversible: stop drinking, liver heals, gut heals, inflammation drops

## Transition: From Liver & Gut to Metabolism

We've covered how alcohol damages our livers and digestive tracts. But there's another cluster of interconnected problems that deserves its own focus: **metabolism and weight gain**.

While liver and gut damage affect how our bodies process and absorb nutrients, metabolic dysfunction affects how our bodies store and burn energy. And after 60, when baseline metabolism is already slower, alcohol creates a convergence of factors promoting weight gain, insulin resistance, and visceral fat accumulation.

Let's look at how alcohol disrupts metabolic function and drives weight gain.
