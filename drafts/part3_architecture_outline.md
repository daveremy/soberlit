# Part III: The Architecture of Thriving — Detailed Outline (REVISED)

> **Purpose:** Transform reader identity from "retired drinker trying to quit" to "optimized elder/athlete choosing to thrive." This is the philosophical foundation that makes the tactical chapters (Part IV) effective.

> **Reader state entering Part III:** "I'm convinced alcohol is harmful (Part II), but nervous. Who will I be without it?"

> **Reader state exiting Part III:** "I'm not 'quitting.' I'm becoming a sovereign modern elder-athlete. I'm excited about this version of myself."

> **Unifying Identity Phrase:** "Sovereign modern elder-athlete" - Someone who owns their choices, stays curious and engaged, and maintains physical capacity to live fully. This phrase recurs throughout Part III.

## Opening: Integration from Part II — Reclaiming Agency and Curiosity

**Purpose:** Brief recap connecting Part II harms to Part III identity transformation. Bridge the gap explicitly. Introduce agency and curiosity as the unifying themes of Part III.

**Key Points:**
- Part II showed what alcohol does: inflammation, cognitive decline, sleep disruption, fall risk, medication interactions, etc.
- **But here's the deeper truth:** Each harm is a theft of agency and curiosity
  - Inflammation steals energy → less agency over your days
  - Poor sleep steals clarity → less capacity to make good choices
  - Cognitive decline steals learning capacity → less curiosity about the world
  - Falls steal independence → ultimate loss of agency
  - Medication interactions steal control over your health
- Every harm alcohol causes is a constraint on your capacity to live actively and curiously
- Removing alcohol isn't just avoiding harm—it's **reclaiming agency and curiosity**

**Agency and Curiosity: The Core of Part III**
- **Agency:** Taking active control of your life—owning choices, shaping trajectory, refusing passive aging
- **Curiosity:** Staying intellectually alive—asking questions, learning constantly, engaging with the world
- These two qualities define successful aging in modern times
- **Alcohol numbs both.** It makes you a passenger (loss of agency) and content with passivity (loss of curiosity)
- Part III is about reclaiming and building both in every domain:
  - Your mortality awareness (agency over how you spend finite time)
  - Your mental frameworks (agency over emotional responses)
  - Your physical capacity (agency over movement and health)
  - Your resilience (agency through chosen adversity)
  - Your relationships (agency and curiosity through connection)
  - Your learning (curiosity through continuous growth)
  - Your daily choices (agency through behavior architecture)

**You're not "quitting drinking"—you're becoming a sovereign modern elder-athlete:**
- **Sovereign:** You own your choices (agency)
- **Modern elder:** You stay curious and engaged with the world (curiosity)
- **Athlete:** You maintain physical capacity to live fully (agency over your body)

This identity runs through every chapter in Part III. Each chapter builds one pillar of agency and curiosity.

**Length:** 750-1,000 words (expanded to establish agency/curiosity as central themes)

**Outcome:** Reader understands:
1. Part II harms are fundamentally about losing agency and curiosity
2. Part III is about reclaiming and building both
3. The "sovereign modern elder-athlete" identity is defined by agency and curiosity
4. Each chapter ahead builds these qualities in a specific domain

---

## Chapter 1: The Mortality Paradox — Living Well Closer to Death

**Core Concept:** Successful aging is successful living, but with mortality awareness. Recognizing our mortality is easier at 60+ and essential to appreciation and urgency.

**Key Points:**
- This book is as much or more about successful aging as alcohol cessation
- At 60+, we're in the autumn of life—20-30 good years left if we're lucky
- Memento mori: remembering death clarifies life priorities
- Not morbid—liberating. "What would I do if I had 20 years left?" (You do.)
- Stoic principles applied:
  - Amor fati (love your fate, including aging)
  - Focus on what you control (daily choices, not outcomes)
  - Negative visualization (imagine losing what you have → appreciation)
- Alcohol is incompatible with mortality awareness—it numbs urgency
- Time is the most precious resource after 60
- Every evening in alcohol-induced haze is evening we don't get back
- This awareness is the foundation for becoming a sovereign modern elder-athlete

**Tone:** Philosophical but grounded. Not morbid or depressing—clarifying and motivating.

**Length:** Write what's needed to convey this clearly. Target 3,000-4,000 words.

**Outcome:** Reader sees remaining years as finite, precious, requiring intentional choices.

---

## Chapter 2: The Emotional Operating System — Managing the Mind

**Core Concept:** Frameworks for identifying real needs, managing expectations, comparison, and judgment. The mental scaffolding for successful aging.

**Why Chapter 2:** Readers need these mental frameworks BEFORE we ask them to adopt physical challenges (Athletes, Adversity). Mental tools come first.

**Key Points:**

### HALT Framework (and expansions)
- Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired—the core needs masquerading as cravings
- Expansion: HALT + Thirst + Stress
- When urge hits: "What do I actually need right now?"
- Meet the real need directly (food, rest, connection, movement) not with alcohol
- Practice: journaling triggers and actual needs
- This becomes instinctive with practice

### Managing Expectations
- Retirement isn't endless vacation—it's life without external structure
- Expect boredom, lack of purpose, identity crisis (especially for men)
- Sobriety won't fix everything—it removes obstacle to fixing things
- Recovery isn't linear—sleep, mood, energy improve but not every day
- Realistic timeline for benefits (weeks to months, not days)
- Don't expect to feel great immediately—expect to feel better gradually

### Managing Comparison
- "Compare and despair"—deadly at any age, especially 60+
- Social media, retirement communities—everyone's highlight reel
- Your only competition: who you were yesterday
- Focus on personal progress, not peer performance
- Comparison kills gratitude and motivation

### Managing Judgment
- Self-judgment: "I should have quit years ago" → Let it go. Start now.
- Judging others who still drink: "They don't know what I know"
- Being judged: "Let them think what they want. I know my reasons."
- Compassion for past self, present struggles, others' choices
- Judgment creates shame; shame drives relapse

### Other Frameworks
- 10-minute rule for cravings (they peak and pass)
- Play the tape forward (imagine drinking tonight → how will tomorrow feel?)
- Cost-benefit analysis (what does alcohol give vs. take?)
- Identity-based decisions (ask "What would a sovereign modern elder-athlete do?")

**Tone:** Practical philosophy. Tools for navigating the mental landscape.

**Length:** 3,500-4,500 words (lots of frameworks to cover)

**Outcome:** Reader has mental frameworks to handle urges, expectations, social comparison. Ready for physical identity chapters.

---

## Chapter 3: We Are All Athletes — The Case for Motion

**Core Concept:** Movement and motion are fundamental to human existence. "Motion is lotion." Fitness is more important as we age, not less, and completely available to seniors who have the time.

**Why Chapter 3:** Now that readers have mental frameworks (Ch 2), they're ready to adopt physical identity.

**Key Points:**
- We are animals first—movement is our nature
- "We are all athletes" philosophy:
  - Not about competition or performance
  - About maintaining the physical capacity to live fully
  - Walking, hiking, strength training, balance work—all athletic pursuits
- "Motion is lotion" for joints, brain, mood, sleep, longevity
- Fitness is completely available to most seniors—we have the time now
- Exercise as non-negotiable pillar (like sleep, nutrition)
- Sarcopenia (muscle loss) after 60—strength training reverses it
- Balance work prevents falls (directly addresses Part II evidence)
- Movement improves every harm alcohol causes: sleep, cognition, mood, inflammation
- Alcohol undermines athletic capacity:
  - Balance and coordination impaired
  - Recovery slowed
  - Motivation and consistency degraded
- **Note on pain/arthritis:** Movement is medicine for joint pain, not cause. Strengthening muscles supports joints. (Address common barrier: "I can't exercise because of arthritis")

**Differentiation from Ch 4 (Adversity):** This chapter is about capacity and maintenance—daily movement, strength, balance. Ch 4 is about voluntary challenge for meaning/contrast.

**Tone:** Empowering. You ARE an athlete. Act like it.

**Length:** 3,000-4,000 words

**Outcome:** Reader reframes self as athlete, sees movement as identity not chore. Part of "sovereign modern elder-athlete" identity.

---

## Chapter 4: Chosen Adversity — Why We Need Challenge

**Core Concept:** Introduce adversity on our own terms to build resilience and cultivate appreciation. Humans appreciate simple luxuries more after controlled challenge.

**Why Chapter 4:** Builds on athletic identity (Ch 3) but goes deeper—challenge for meaning, not just maintenance.

**Key Points:**
- Comfort-seeking culture has made us soft and numb
- We need challenge to appreciate ease
- Endurance crew example: Shackleton's crew, 19 months in Antarctic → glass of water became luxury
  - Not just survival story—lesson about relative value
  - A "boring" sober evening becomes peaceful after you stop chasing highs
  - Hot shower feels better after cold walk; rest feels better after exertion
- Modern equivalent: hiking, rucking, long walks, cold exposure, intermittent fasting
- Voluntary discomfort builds:
  - Physical resilience (strength, endurance)
  - Mental toughness (stress tolerance)
  - Appreciation for simple pleasures (hot shower, warm bed, good meal, clear morning)
- Antifragility (Nassim Taleb): systems that gain from stressors
  - Muscles grow from resistance
  - Bones strengthen from impact
  - Minds sharpen from challenge
  - This is biology, not philosophy
- Alcohol is the opposite of antifragility—it's a crutch that makes you weaker
- Alcohol reduces stress resilience, makes you fragile
- Choose your hard: hiking uphill now, or unable to walk stairs at 75?

**Differentiation from Ch 3 (Athletes):** Ch 3 = capacity/maintenance. Ch 4 = deliberate stress for meaning/contrast/appreciation.

**Tone:** Adventurous, inspiring. Not punishing yourself—building yourself.

**Length:** 3,000-4,000 words

**Outcome:** Reader sees challenge as gift, begins to seek it rather than avoid it. Understands that sobriety itself is voluntary adversity that builds antifragility.

---

## Chapter 5: Connection, Community & Building Your Network

**Core Concept:** Build support networks before you need them (you need it now, but invaluable later). Connection is a pillar of successful aging and longevity. Purpose and meaning come from connection to others and to something larger than self.

**Key Points:**
- Blue Zones research: strong social ties = longer, healthier life
- Loneliness after 60—especially for men, especially retired
- Alcohol was fake connection (numbed presence, degraded memory)
- Sober connection is real connection—fully present, fully remembered
- Types of connection needed:
  - Intimate (spouse/partner—showing up sober)
  - Close friends (2-3 people you can call at 2 AM)
  - Community (groups, clubs, volunteering)
  - Weak ties (neighbors, acquaintances—still valuable for well-being)
- Building network now (not waiting for crisis):
  - Join groups aligned with new identity (hiking club, book club, volunteer org)
  - Reconnect with old friends you drifted from
  - Be the inviter (don't wait to be invited)
  - Show up consistently
- Grandparenting presence: being the grandparent you want to be
- Repairing strained relationships (if alcohol was a factor)

### THE MALE FRIENDSHIP DEFICIT (Critical for retired men)
- **This is a crisis, not just a "nice to have"**
- Men lose "work buddy" structure at retirement—primary social scaffolding disappears
- Male socialization often centered around alcohol—removing it exposes void
- Men less likely to maintain friendships, initiate social contact, join groups
- Loneliness kills (comparable risk to smoking 15 cigarettes/day)
- **Action required:** Be intentional, be the inviter, show up vulnerable
- Join activity-based groups (easier for men than talk-based groups)
- Reconnect with old friends—they're waiting for someone to reach out
- This is non-negotiable for successful aging

### PARTNER STILL DRINKS (Common reality)
- **Philosophical stance:** Your sobriety is your choice, not judgment of them
- You control your choices, not theirs
- Don't evangelize, don't preach, don't guilt
- Lead by example: let them see you thriving
- Practical tactics covered in Part IV (Relationships chapter)
- This tests your conviction: can you stay sober when alcohol is in your home?
- If you're truly resolved, their drinking doesn't threaten you

### GRIEF, LOSS, AND SPOUSAL DECLINE (Reality of aging)
- Sobriety doesn't protect you from loss—but numbing doesn't help either
- Grief demands to be felt; alcohol only delays it
- Being present in grief is hard but necessary
- Supporting a declining spouse requires full presence
- Alcohol would make you less available when they need you most
- Connection to support network is critical during loss

### PURPOSE AND MEANING (Unifying theme)
- Connection provides meaning (ikigai, eudaimonia, self-determination theory)
- Humans need: autonomy (control), competence (growth), relatedness (connection)
- Sobriety enables all three; alcohol undermines all three
- Purpose comes from contributing to others (mentoring, volunteering, grandparenting)
- Meaning comes from being fully present in relationships
- This is the "why" behind the "sovereign modern elder-athlete" identity

**Tone:** Warm, practical. Connection is both philosophy and action. For men: urgent call to action. For all: this is non-negotiable.

**Length:** 4,000-5,000 words (lots to cover: connection types, male deficit, partner dynamics, grief, purpose)

**Outcome:** Reader sees connection as essential, begins building/strengthening network. Men especially understand this is life-or-death important. Understands purpose comes from connection.

## Chapter 6: The Modern Elder — Curiosity & Agency

**Core Concept:** Maintain curiosity about the world and agency over your life through continuous learning and technology. These are the antidotes to passive aging decline.

**REVISED: Tighter focus based on Codex feedback. Cut or minimize finance/spending unless tied to agency over time/health. Add dementia-protection frame throughout.**

**Unifying Theme: Curiosity & Agency**
- **Curiosity:** Staying intellectually alive, asking questions, learning constantly
- **Agency:** Taking control of your health, knowledge, and learning trajectory
- These are the antidotes to the passive decline narrative of aging
- Alcohol numbs both—curiosity about the world and sense of agency over your life
- **Dementia protection:** Everything in this chapter protects cognitive reserve

**Key Points:**

### Building Cognitive Reserve Through Reading (Dementia Protection)
- **Cognitive reserve:** The brain's buffer against dementia (explicit scientific term)
- Reading is one of the most effective ways to build cognitive reserve
- Novelty + complexity = stronger reserve (diverse reading genres)
- "Read, read, read"—foundation of curiosity and mental sharpness
- Goal: 50-100 books/year (very achievable in retirement)
- Audible for volume (while walking, driving, doing chores—dual-tasking for brain)
- Physical books when possible (better retention, fewer distractions)
- Diverse reading: history, science, philosophy, biography, fiction
- Alcohol impairs reading (focus, retention, enjoyment all degraded)
- **Agency:** You control what you learn and how fast you grow
- **Dementia protection:** Every book is an investment in cognitive reserve

### Leveraging AI & Technology (Staying Relevant & Curious)
- You're not "too old" for technology—you're the perfect age for wisdom + tools
- AI as research assistant (health questions, understanding medications, summarizing papers)
- AI as learning partner (teaching new skills, explaining concepts, challenging ideas)
- AI as conversation partner (exploring ideas, mitigating loneliness)
- Practical uses for cognitive protection:
  - Learning languages (powerful for brain plasticity)
  - Learning instruments, complex hobbies
  - Understanding medical diagnoses and treatment options
  - Exploring topics you never had time for during working years
- Overcoming technophobia: AI is tool for agency, not threat
- Examples: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini for different use cases
- **Agency:** You're not dependent on others to understand the world
- **Dementia protection:** Learning new skills (especially languages, music) builds reserve

### Staying Engaged in the World (Curiosity in Action)
- Volunteering (mentoring, tutoring, community service)—teaches you as much as it gives
- Part-time work or consulting (on your terms—using expertise you've built)
- Creative pursuits (writing, art, music, making)—novelty + complexity
- Political/civic engagement (informed citizenship, staying relevant)
- Intergenerational connection (learning from younger people, avoiding obsolescence)
- Travel (experiencing other cultures, perspectives, languages)
- **Curiosity:** The world is endlessly interesting if you show up
- **Dementia protection:** Novel experiences and social engagement are protective

### Allocating Resources for Health & Time (Agency Over Your Future)
- **REVISED:** Cut general finance/spending philosophy. Focus only on: spending for health and time.
- Money as tool for agency over your remaining years
- Spending on health is non-negotiable: gym membership, nutrition, medical care, sleep gear
- Spending on experiences (travel, learning) vs. stuff
- Spending on connection (hosting dinners, flying to see grandkids, creating memories)
- Alcohol was wasting money on harm (calculate: $X/month × 12 × 20 years = $Y wasted on damage)
- Redirect alcohol budget to investments in capacity: gym, books, travel, supplements
- **Agency:** Your resources serve your vision of sovereign modern elder-athlete
- **Dementia protection:** Spending on learning and experiences is spending on cognitive reserve

### Bio-Trackers & Self-Knowledge (Curiosity About Your Own System)
- Sleep trackers (Oura, Whoop, Apple Watch)—HRV, sleep stages, readiness
- Curiosity: "How does my body respond to this meal/workout/sleep schedule?"
- Feedback loops: track → adjust → measure → improve
- This is self-optimization, not obsession (use as tools, not identity)
- Alcohol made you numb to your body's signals—sobriety restores awareness
- **Note:** Specific implementation of bio-trackers covered in Part IV (Movement, Sleep, Nutrition chapters)
- **Agency:** You're monitoring and optimizing your own health
- **Note:** Don't need expensive trackers—journaling sleep/mood/energy is powerful too

**Tone:** Forward-looking, optimistic, empowering. You are not a passive recipient of aging. You are an active architect of your future.

**Length:** 3,500-4,500 words (tightened from original—focus on curiosity/agency/dementia protection, minimize finance)

**Outcome:** Reader sees self as curious explorer and active agent. Learning, technology, self-knowledge, and engagement are expressions of agency and curiosity. Part of "sovereign modern elder-athlete" identity. Understands dementia protection as unifying theme.

## Chapter 7: Behavior Architecture — Translating Identity into Action (NEW)

**Core Concept:** You have the identity and philosophy. Now you need the behavior-change bridge to make it real. This is how to translate "I am a sovereign modern elder-athlete" into daily choices.

**Why This Chapter:** Codex identified missing bridge between philosophy (Part III) and tactics (Part IV). This is the crucial link.

**Key Points:**

### Implementation Intentions
- "If-then" plans: "If I feel an urge at 6 PM, then I will walk around the block"
- Pre-decide responses to triggers, don't rely on willpower in the moment
- Examples:
  - If bored → then read/call friend/walk
  - If stressed → then breath work/physical exertion
  - If social pressure → then [social script from Part IV]
- Write these down, rehearse them mentally

### Environment Design
- Make alcohol-free choices the path of least resistance
- Remove alcohol from home (or make it inaccessible if partner drinks)
- Stock NA alternatives in visible, accessible places
- Redesign "drinking triggers": change chair, change room, change routine
- Make movement easy: shoes by door, gym bag in car, weights visible
- Make reading easy: book on nightstand, Audible app on phone home screen

### Habit Stacking
- Attach new behaviors to existing habits
- "After I pour coffee, I read for 10 minutes" (not "I'll read more")
- "After dinner, I walk for 15 minutes" (not "I'll exercise more")
- Build on what already works

### Trigger-Swap Mechanics
- Identify your specific triggers (HALT helps here)
- Map each trigger to a predetermined swap:
  - "Treat" trigger → fruit, dark chocolate, NA spritz
  - "Stress" trigger → walk, breath work, cold shower
  - "Social" trigger → NA craft drink, focus on conversation not drink
  - "Boredom" trigger → book, hobby, call friend
- Practice swaps before triggers hit

### Friction Engineering
- Add friction to old behaviors (alcohol): remove from environment, add steps
- Remove friction from new behaviors: lay out gym clothes night before, pre-load Audible queue
- Make the identity-aligned choice the easiest choice

### Identity Reinforcement
- Daily reminder: "I am a sovereign modern elder-athlete"
- Ask before choices: "What would that person do?"
- Celebrate identity-aligned choices (not outcomes)
- Journal wins: "Today I chose X because I am Y"

### Activation Checklist (Bridge to Part IV)
Before moving to Part IV tactics, complete these:
1. [ ] Write down your top 3 triggers and predetermined swaps
2. [ ] Clear alcohol from your space (or make plan if partner drinks)
3. [ ] Stock 3 NA alternatives you actually like
4. [ ] Identify one "identity habit" to start tomorrow (from Part IV)
5. [ ] Write your implementation intention: "If [trigger], then [action]"

**Tone:** Practical, actionable. This is where philosophy meets behavior science.

**Length:** 2,500-3,500 words (focused on behavior change mechanics)

**Outcome:** Reader has concrete tools to translate identity into daily choices. Ready for Part IV tactics with implementation framework in place.

---

## Integration Section: How Alcohol Undermines Every Element

**Purpose:** Tie Part III back to Part II evidence. Show how alcohol degrades each pillar of the "sovereign modern elder-athlete" identity.

**Quick hits:**
- **Mortality awareness:** Alcohol numbs urgency, steals time from finite years
- **Mental frameworks:** Degrades ability to identify needs, manage expectations, resist comparison
- **Athletic capacity:** Impairs balance, coordination, recovery, motivation, consistency
- **Adversity tolerance:** Reduces stress resilience, makes you fragile, eliminates antifragility
- **Connection:** Numbs presence, impairs memory of events, creates conflict, isolates
- **Curiosity & Agency:** Impairs focus, retention, motivation to learn; numbs sense of control
- **Behavior change:** Makes environment design impossible, undermines implementation intentions

**Length:** 500 words (brief recap)

**Outcome:** Reader sees alcohol as incompatible with every pillar of the "sovereign modern elder-athlete" identity.

---

## Part III Summary & Bridge to Part IV

**Summary:**
You've seen the evidence (Part II). You understand the harms. Now you have the philosophical foundation—the identity, frameworks, and behavior-change tools—to build a thriving life.

You're not a "person trying to quit drinking."

You're a **sovereign modern elder-athlete.** You own your choices. You stay curious and engaged. You maintain the physical capacity to live fully. You have the mental frameworks to handle urges. You seek challenge instead of comfort. You build connection. You protect your cognitive reserve. You translate identity into action.

**Bridge to Part IV:**
Philosophy and behavior architecture are necessary but not sufficient. You need specific tools.

Part IV gives you the tactical strategies to execute this identity:
- Social scripts for handling pressure
- Movement protocols for building athletic capacity
- Nutrition and supplements for fueling performance
- Sleep rituals for restoration
- Hydration and substitutes for situational swaps
- Hobbies for engagement
- Spirituality practices for meaning
- Relationship strategies for connection

You have the identity. You have the behavior-change framework. Now get the toolkit.

**Length:** 500 words

## Writing Notes for Part III

**Tone:** Morgan Housel-style conceptual writing. Philosophical but grounded. Inspiring but not motivational-speaker fluff. Personal stories welcome. Citations where relevant but lighter than Part II.

**Length:** Write what's needed to convey concepts clearly. Don't artificially constrain. Target ranges:
- Opening: 500-750 words
- Ch 1 (Mortality): 3,000-4,000 words
- Ch 2 (Emotional OS): 3,500-4,500 words
- Ch 3 (Athletes): 3,000-4,000 words
- Ch 4 (Adversity): 3,000-4,000 words
- Ch 5 (Connection): 4,000-5,000 words
- Ch 6 (Modern Elder): 3,500-4,500 words
- Ch 7 (Behavior Architecture): 2,500-3,500 words
- Integration: 500 words
- Bridge: 500 words
**Part III Total: ~24,000-30,000 words**

**Voice:** Continue "we" voice. Solidarity. "We are becoming sovereign modern elder-athletes together."

**Integration:** Each chapter should reference Part II evidence lightly (showing how alcohol undermines this pillar) and reference forward to Part IV tactics (where reader will get tools to execute).

**Unifying Identity Phrase:** Use "sovereign modern elder-athlete" throughout Part III. Make it a recurring anchor.

**User's Personal Journey:** Can weave in author's experience with these frameworks as they're implemented in the 30/60/90 plan (Part V).

---

## Missing Content to Address (From Codex Review)

### Pain/Arthritis
- **Placement:** Chapter 3 (Athletes)
- **Key point:** Movement is medicine for joint pain, not cause. Address barrier: "I can't exercise because of arthritis."

### Sleep Apnea
- **Placement:** Part II Sleep chapter (minor addition) OR Part IV Sleep Rituals
- **Key point:** If snoring/waking gasping, get screened. Huge for 60+ health. Alcohol makes it worse.

### Grief/Loss/Spousal Decline
- **Placement:** Chapter 5 (Connection)
- **Key points:** Sobriety doesn't protect from loss, but numbing doesn't help. Grief demands presence. Supporting declining spouse requires full capacity.

### Partner Still Drinks
- **Placement:** Chapter 5 (Connection) for philosophy + Part IV Relationships for tactics
- **Key points:** Your choice, not theirs. Don't evangelize. Lead by example. Tests your conviction.

### Financial Stress as Trigger
- **Placement:** Chapter 2 (Emotional OS) under Managing Expectations
- **Key point:** Fixed income stress is real. Sobriety won't fix it, but alcohol makes it worse. HALT applies here too (stress trigger).

---
