# Audit 2: The Pump (Cardiovascular)

> **The Mechanism:** Cardiovascular Stress
> **The Cost:** Your Endurance

Let's talk about the engine.

For men over 60, the heart is the primary point of failure. It is the thing we worry about when we feel a twinge in our chest. It is the reason we take statins and check our blood pressure.

There is a myth we love to tell ourselves: *"Alcohol is good for the heart. Red wine clears the arteries. The French do it."*

We covered the "French Paradox" lie in Part I. Now let's look at the engineering reality.

## The Hydraulics: Blood Pressure

Your cardiovascular system is a pressurized hydraulic system.

Alcohol is a vasodilator (expands vessels) initially, but as it metabolizes, it triggers a rebound **vasoconstriction** and a spike in cortisol.

Translation: **It spikes your pressure.**

If you are managing hypertension (and most men over 60 are), drinking alcohol is sabotaging your own efforts. You take a pill to lower pressure in the morning, and you drink a solvent that raises it in the evening. You are fighting yourself.

**The Data:**
A meta-analysis of 36 trials (Roerecke et al., 2017) showed that reducing alcohol intake significantly lowers blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner. Cutting intake by 50% can lower systolic BP by ~5.5 mmHg. That is often the difference between needing medication and not.

## The Electrical System: Atrial Fibrillation

The heart is also an electrical system. Alcohol disrupts the timing signal.

**Holiday Heart Syndrome** is the medical term for alcohol-induced atrial fibrillation (AFib). It’s the #1 trigger for arrhythmia.

If you’ve ever woken up at 3 AM with your heart fluttering or pounding like a trapped bird, that wasn't "anxiety." That was your electrical system misfiring due to ethanol toxicity.

For men over 60, AFib is a major stroke risk. Why voluntarily trigger it?

### [DIAGRAM REQUEST: The Rhythm Disruption]
*   **Visual:** EKG line.
*   **Top Line:** Steady, rhythmic heartbeat (Sober).
*   **Bottom Line:** Erratic, chaotic spikes (Alcohol/AFib).
*   **Caption:** "Alcohol disrupts the heart's electrical signaling."

## The J-Curve Myth (The "Moderate" Lie)

You will hear people cite old studies showing a "J-Curve"—that moderate drinkers have fewer heart attacks than abstainers.

Here is the data correction:
Those "abstainers" included people who quit *because they were already sick*. When you filter out the sick people, the "benefit" of alcohol disappears.

The reality: **Stroke, heart failure, and fatal hypertension risk rise steadily above ~7 drinks a week.** (Wood et al., 2018 - Analysis of 600,000 drinkers).

## The Integrated Man Angle: Performance

This isn't just about avoiding a heart attack. It's about **Stroke Volume**. It's about **VO2 Max**.

You want to be the guy who can hike the trail, carry the luggage, and handle the stairs without gassing out. You want an engine that runs cool and efficient.

Alcohol puts sugar in the gas tank. It stresses the pump. It messes with the timing belt.

If you want to protect the asset, stop poisoning the system.
