# The Situation: Alcohol in Retired Life

Retirement can open space—more dinners out, book clubs, vacations, evenings at home. Alcohol often slides in as the default social glue, a relaxant, or a boredom fix. For many over 60, that means daily or near-daily drinking layered onto changing sleep, slower metabolism, and more medications.

The evidence suggests: alcohol is counterproductive to health goals after 60. It's **a source of physiological stress that reduces energy, balance, and cognition** while appearing to provide relaxation. The perceived benefits often result from temporary relief from withdrawal or stress that alcohol itself created.

## What this chapter covers
- **How alcohol shows up:** sunset drinks, standing “wine o’clock,” golf/clubhouse culture, cruises/travel, celebrations, solitary evening pours.
- **Physiology shifts with age:** less body water, slower metabolism → higher BAC per drink; balance and reaction time slow; bone density declines; sleep fragments more easily.
- **Polypharmacy:** more BP meds, anticoagulants/antiplatelets, diabetes meds, sedatives → higher interaction risk with alcohol.
- **Baseline risks are higher:** hypertension, arrhythmias, osteopenia, fall risk, cognitive vulnerability all increase with age.
- **Normalization:** peers/family may expect or encourage drinking; myths (heart benefit, social ease, sleep aid) keep the pattern in place.

## Crosswalk to the evidence chapters
- **Heart/BP/AF:** risk rises above ~1 drink/day; BP and rhythm improve when alcohol drops; no protective J-curve after bias correction ([Wood2018], [Roerecke2017], [Voskoboinik2020]).
- **Cancer:** Group 1 carcinogen; no safe floor; risk starts at the first drink ([Bagnardi2015], [WHO2023]).
- **Brain & sleep:** “Moderate” intake tied to hippocampal atrophy; dementia risk climbs with higher intake; alcohol fragments REM/SWS ([Topiwala2017], [Sabia2018], [Roehrs1999]/[RoehrsRothReview]).
- **Falls/balance:** acute drinking sharply raises injury odds; older adults pay a higher price (fractures/hips) ([Taylor2010], [Ke2023]).
- **Med interactions:** bleed, hypotension, hypoglycemia, sedation/resp depression; polypharmacy magnifies risk ([NIAAAClinGuide], [FDABoxed]).
- **Mental health:** alcohol’s rebound fuels anxiety/low mood; higher use doubles odds of depression; comorbid anxiety links ([Boden2011], [Lees2020]).

The aim here is to make the landscape clear: in a retired life with more unstructured time, alcohol’s costs stack faster and hit harder. The following chapters lay out the evidence and debunk the myths before we talk about change.*** End Patch
