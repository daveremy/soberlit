# Metabolism, Weight, and Inflammation (60+ focus)

> Problem framing; keep solutions for later chapters.

After 60, alcohol doesn't just damage specific organs, it disrupts the fundamental metabolic and inflammatory processes that underlie successful aging. Weight creeps up even when eating the same. Chronic low-grade inflammation accelerates every age-related disease. And alcohol is a major driver of both.

## Why older adults are more vulnerable

With slower baseline metabolism, progressive muscle loss (sarcopenia), and a phenomenon called "inflammaging" (baseline inflammation that increases with age), our bodies are already fighting to maintain metabolic health and keep inflammation in check. Alcohol undermines both battles simultaneously.

## Weight Gain and Metabolic Disruption

**Alcohol blocks fat burning.** When you drink, your liver stops metabolizing fat to prioritize clearing alcohol (which your body treats as a toxin). Everything you eat while drinking, and for hours afterward, gets stored rather than burned. This effect is more pronounced in older adults whose baseline fat oxidation is already slower.

**Alcohol is calorie-dense with zero nutrition.** At 7 calories per gram, alcohol is nearly as calorie-dense as pure fat (9 cal/g) but offers zero protein, vitamins, or minerals. Two glasses of wine add 250-300 empty calories on top of whatever you eat.

**Alcohol dysregulates appetite and food choices.** It increases ghrelin (the hunger hormone), reduces leptin sensitivity (the satiety signal), and lowers inhibitions around food. You eat more, make worse choices, and don't feel full when you should.

**Sleep disruption drives weight gain.** Alcohol fragments your sleep, which disrupts leptin and ghrelin balance the next day, elevates cortisol, and increases insulin resistance. Poor sleep from drinking makes you hungrier, crave high-calorie foods, and store more visceral fat.

**The age factor matters.** Research on older adults shows the relationship between alcohol and weight is dose-dependent and age-specific. In the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study of adults 70-79, alcohol intake correlated with higher BMI. In postmenopausal women, regular drinking was associated with increased body weight over time, even at "moderate" levels.

Korean research found increased risk of metabolic syndrome and obesity in men, women, and elderly who drink more than 14 grams per day (about one standard drink) compared to non-drinkers. In those with existing obesity, abdominal obesity, or metabolic concerns, even 7 grams per day (half a drink) increased metabolic syndrome risk.

## Inflammation: The Silent Accelerator

**Alcohol triggers systemic inflammation.** It increases gut permeability ("leaky gut"), allowing bacterial endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides, LPS) to enter the bloodstream. These endotoxins activate immune cells throughout the body, triggering release of pro-inflammatory cytokines: interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and C-reactive protein (CRP).

**The dose-response is clear.** The Health, Aging, and Body Composition study measured inflammatory markers in 3,075 adults aged 70-79. In women, CRP showed a J-shaped curve: 2.69 mg/L in non-drinkers, 2.25 in light drinkers (up to 15 g/day), 2.32 in moderate drinkers (15-30 g/day), and 3.18 in heavy drinkers (over 30 g/day). In men, the relationship was linear, CRP rose steadily with intake.

For IL-6, individuals with alcohol use disorder had significantly higher levels than healthy controls. The pattern is consistent: more alcohol = more inflammation.

**Gut microbiome dysbiosis amplifies inflammation.** Alcohol disrupts the gut microbiome, reducing beneficial bacteria (Faecalibacterium, Roseburia) that produce anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty acids. The resulting dysbiosis increases endotoxin levels, which activates liver Kupffer cells and promotes inflammatory cytokine production, creating a self-reinforcing inflammatory cycle.

**Chronic inflammation drives age-related disease.** Elevated IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP are predictors of cardiovascular disease, cancer, dementia, arthritis, and all-cause mortality in older adults. Aging already involves chronic low-grade inflammation ("inflammaging"). Alcohol pours fuel on that fire.

**The gut-liver-brain axis.** Alcohol-induced gut permeability and dysbiosis don't just affect the gut and liver. Inflammatory signals travel to the brain via the vagus nerve and bloodstream, contributing to neuroinflammation, cognitive decline, and mood disorders. This helps explain why alcohol worsens both brain function and mental health.

## The Compounding Effect After 60

Weight gain and inflammation aren't separate problems, they reinforce each other. Visceral fat (the kind that accumulates with alcohol and poor sleep) is metabolically active, secreting inflammatory cytokines. More inflammation worsens insulin resistance, which drives more fat storage. Chronic inflammation also accelerates muscle loss (sarcopenia), which further slows metabolism.

This creates a downward spiral:
- Alcohol → weight gain + inflammation
- Weight gain → more inflammation + insulin resistance
- Inflammation → muscle loss + slower metabolism
- Slower metabolism → more weight gain from same intake
- Repeat

After 60, breaking this cycle is harder because baseline metabolism and muscle mass are already declining. Every drink makes it worse.

## The Successful Aging Angle

Metabolic health and low inflammation are foundational to everything else we care about: energy, mobility, independence, brain function, disease prevention. You can't have successful aging with chronic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. Your body is fighting too hard just to stay stable.

Alcohol is incompatible with metabolic optimization. It blocks fat burning, disrupts appetite regulation, fragments sleep, inflames the gut, elevates systemic inflammatory markers, and creates a metabolic environment that accelerates aging and disease.

Every alcohol-free day gives your metabolism a chance to reset, your gut microbiome a chance to recover, and your inflammatory markers a chance to drop. The research shows these changes happen quickly: gut permeability improves within weeks, inflammatory markers decline, weight stabilizes or drops, and metabolic health improves.

This isn't about vanity or fitting into old clothes. It's about having the metabolic capacity and low-inflammation state needed to thrive in your 60s, 70s, and 80s.

## Key takeaways (scan)

- Alcohol blocks fat burning; liver prioritizes alcohol clearance over fat metabolism
- 7 cal/g, nearly as calorie-dense as fat, zero nutrition
- Dysregulates appetite (increases ghrelin, reduces leptin sensitivity)
- Sleep disruption from alcohol → cortisol elevation → insulin resistance → visceral fat
- Increases gut permeability, allowing endotoxins into bloodstream
- Elevates inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-α, CRP) in dose-dependent manner
- Disrupts gut microbiome, reduces anti-inflammatory bacteria
- Inflammation + weight gain reinforce each other, accelerating aging
- After 60, baseline metabolism slower and inflammation higher; alcohol compounds both

## Transition: From Systemic Damage to Solutions

We've now covered the full picture of what alcohol does to the aging body: heart damage, cancer risk, brain atrophy, sleep destruction, fall risk, medication interactions, mental health erosion, and now the underlying metabolic and inflammatory damage that accelerates all of it.

The evidence is clear. The harm is measurable. And the dose-response is consistent: less is better, none is safest.

But here's the good news: **all of this is reversible.** Your metabolism can reset. Your gut can heal. Your inflammatory markers can drop. Your weight can stabilize. And the strategies to make that happen are straightforward.

Let's talk about solutions.
