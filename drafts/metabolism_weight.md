# Metabolism & Weight Gain

> Problem framing; keep solutions for later chapters.

Here's the paradox many people experience: alcohol can cause malabsorption (you can't absorb nutrients properly) but also causes weight gain (you accumulate fat). How?

The answer lies in how alcohol disrupts your metabolism, the complex system that determines whether your body burns fat or stores it.

After 60, baseline metabolism naturally slows. Muscle mass decreases (sarcopenia), which further reduces metabolic rate. Adding alcohol on top of these age-related changes creates a metabolic trap that makes weight gain nearly inevitable.

## The Metabolic Trap: How Alcohol Drives Weight Gain

### Alcohol Blocks Fat Burning

When you drink, your liver prioritizes metabolizing alcohol. It's a toxin, so your body treats it as an urgent threat.

While the liver is clearing alcohol, it stops burning fat. Fat oxidation halts. Anything you eat while drinking, and for hours afterward, gets stored as fat rather than burned for energy.

This effect may be more pronounced in older adults, whose baseline fat oxidation is already slower due to age-related metabolic slowdown.

### Alcohol Is Calorie-Dense with Zero Nutrition

At 7 calories per gram, alcohol is nearly as calorie-dense as pure fat (9 cal/g). Two glasses of wine add 250-300 empty calories on top of whatever you eat.

But unlike fat, protein, or carbohydrates, alcohol provides zero nutrition. No vitamins, no minerals, no fiber, no protein. Just calories that get stored as fat.

### Alcohol Dysregulates Appetite

Research suggests alcohol increases ghrelin (the hunger hormone) and decreases leptin sensitivity (the satiety signal). You may eat more, make worse food choices, and not feel full when you should.

Ever notice how after a few drinks, you crave salty, fatty, high-calorie foods? That's not coincidence. Alcohol may dysregulate the hormones that control hunger and satiety.

### Sleep Disruption → Cortisol → Insulin Resistance → Visceral Fat

We covered sleep disruption in Chapter 5. Poor sleep from alcohol elevates cortisol (stress hormone), which may increase insulin resistance.

Insulin resistance means your cells don't respond to insulin properly. Glucose stays in the bloodstream. Your pancreas releases more insulin. High insulin signals your body to store fat, especially visceral fat (the dangerous fat around your organs).

Visceral fat is metabolically active, secreting inflammatory cytokines (tying back to Chapter 1 on inflammation). More visceral fat may mean more inflammation, which may mean more insulin resistance, which may mean more fat storage. It's a potential vicious cycle.

## The Compounding Effect After 60

Weight gain and metabolic dysfunction compound faster after 60:

- **Alcohol → poor sleep → cortisol elevation → insulin resistance → weight gain**
- **Weight gain (visceral fat) → more inflammation → worsens insulin resistance**
- **Slower baseline metabolism (age-related) + alcohol blocking fat oxidation = rapid fat accumulation**
- **Muscle loss (sarcopenia) → slower metabolism → same calories = more weight gain**
- **Inflammation already elevated (inflammaging) + visceral fat secreting cytokines = severe chronic inflammation**

And after 60, all of this happens faster:
- Baseline metabolism is slower (same calories = more weight gain)
- Muscle mass is lower (sarcopenia), which further slows metabolism
- Inflammation is already elevated (inflammaging + alcohol + visceral fat = compounded inflammation)
- Sleep quality already declining (age-related changes + alcohol = severe sleep deprivation)

## The Successful Aging Angle

Metabolic health is foundational to maintaining independence, energy, and physical capacity. You can't maintain muscle mass with chronic insulin resistance. You can't have energy without efficient fat burning. You can't stay mobile and active with excess visceral fat driving inflammation.

Alcohol sabotages metabolism in multiple ways:
- Blocks fat burning (liver prioritizes alcohol clearance)
- 7 cal/g, calorie-dense, zero nutrition
- May dysregulate appetite hormones
- Drives visceral fat accumulation through sleep disruption, cortisol elevation, and insulin resistance

And these aren't abstract, long-term risks. These are immediate, measurable consequences.

The belly fat you can't lose? Alcohol is likely a primary driver: it blocks fat oxidation + sleep disruption drives insulin resistance.

The pre-diabetes diagnosis? That may be insulin resistance from chronic alcohol consumption and visceral fat accumulation.

The constant hunger despite eating enough? That could be alcohol dysregulating your appetite hormones.

All of it is connected. All of it may be driven by alcohol. Much of it is reversible.

Stop drinking, and within weeks:
- Fat oxidation resumes (liver is no longer prioritizing alcohol clearance)
- Weight may stabilize or drop
- Insulin sensitivity may improve
- Appetite regulation may normalize
- Inflammation drops (less visceral fat, better sleep, lower cortisol)

This isn't theory. This is what research suggests happens when you remove the toxin and let your body heal.

## Key takeaways (scan)

- Alcohol blocks fat oxidation (liver prioritizes alcohol clearance)
- 7 cal/g, nearly as calorie-dense as fat, zero nutrition
- May dysregulate appetite (increases ghrelin, decreases leptin sensitivity)
- Sleep disruption → cortisol → insulin resistance → visceral fat accumulation
- Visceral fat secretes inflammatory cytokines (compounding inflammation from Chapter 1)
- After 60: slower baseline metabolism, lower muscle mass, higher inflammation, worse sleep
- Creates potential vicious cycle: alcohol → poor sleep → cortisol → insulin resistance → visceral fat → inflammation → worse insulin resistance → more fat storage
- Much of this may be reversible: stop drinking, fat oxidation resumes, weight stabilizes, insulin sensitivity improves, appetite regulation normalizes, inflammation drops

## Transition: From Evidence to Solutions

We've now covered the complete picture of alcohol's harm:
- Chronic inflammation (the foundational fire driving all other harms)
- Heart damage and blood pressure
- Cancer risk (no safe floor)
- Dementia and memory loss
- Sleep destruction
- Falls and fractures
- Dangerous drug interactions
- Anxiety and depression
- Liver and digestive health
- Metabolism and weight gain

The evidence is comprehensive. The harm is measurable. The dose-response is consistent: less is better, none may be safest.

But here's the good news, and it's the reason this book exists: **Much of this may be reversible.**

Your gut can heal. Your liver can clear fat. Your sleep can improve. Your inflammatory markers may drop. Your weight can stabilize. Your brain may regain clarity. Your energy can return.

The next section is about how to make that happen. The frameworks, the strategies, the lived experience of what it actually looks like to release alcohol and build a Sober Lit life.

Let's talk about solutions.
