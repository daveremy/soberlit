# Metabolism & Weight Gain

Here's the paradox many people experience: alcohol can cause malabsorption (we can't absorb nutrients properly) but also causes weight gain (we accumulate fat). How?

The answer lies in how alcohol disrupts our metabolism, the complex system that determines whether our bodies burns fat or stores it.

After 60, baseline metabolism naturally slows. Muscle mass decreases (sarcopenia), which further reduces metabolic rate. Adding alcohol on top of these age-related changes creates a metabolic environment that significantly promotes weight gain.

## The Metabolic Environment: How Alcohol Drives Weight Gain

### Alcohol Blocks Fat Burning

When we drink, our livers prioritizes metabolizing alcohol. It's a toxin, so our bodies treats it as an urgent threat.

While the liver is clearing alcohol, it stops burning fat. Fat oxidation halts. Anything we eat while drinking, and for hours afterward, gets stored as fat rather than burned for energy.

This effect is more pronounced in older adults, whose baseline fat oxidation is already slower due to age-related metabolic slowdown.

### Alcohol Is Calorie-Dense with Zero Nutrition

At 7 calories per gram, alcohol is nearly as calorie-dense as pure fat (9 cal/g). Two glasses of wine add 250-300 empty calories on top of whatever you eat.

But unlike fat, protein, or carbohydrates, alcohol provides zero nutrition. No vitamins, no minerals, no fiber, no protein. Just calories that get stored as fat.

### Alcohol Dysregulates Appetite

Research shows alcohol increases ghrelin (the hunger hormone) and decreases leptin sensitivity (the satiety signal). We eat more, make worse food choices, and don't feel full when we should.

Ever notice how after a few drinks, we crave salty, fatty, high-calorie foods? That's not coincidence. Alcohol dysregulates the hormones that control hunger and satiety.

### Sleep Disruption → Cortisol → Insulin Resistance → Visceral Fat

We covered sleep disruption in Chapter 5. Poor sleep from alcohol elevates cortisol (stress hormone), which may increase insulin resistance.

Insulin resistance means our cells don't respond to insulin properly. Glucose stays in the bloodstream. Our pancreas releases more insulin. High insulin signals our bodies to store fat, especially visceral fat (the dangerous fat around our organs).

Visceral fat is metabolically active, secreting inflammatory cytokines (tying back to Chapter 1 on inflammation). More visceral fat means more inflammation, which means more insulin resistance, which means more fat storage. It's a vicious cycle.

## The Compounding Effect After 60

Weight gain and metabolic dysfunction compound faster after 60:

- **Alcohol → poor sleep → cortisol elevation → insulin resistance → weight gain**
- **Weight gain (visceral fat) → more inflammation → worsens insulin resistance**
- **Slower baseline metabolism (age-related) + alcohol blocking fat oxidation = rapid fat accumulation**
- **Muscle loss (sarcopenia) → slower metabolism → same calories = more weight gain**
- **Inflammation already elevated (inflammaging) + visceral fat secreting cytokines = severe chronic inflammation**

And after 60, all of this happens faster:
- Baseline metabolism is slower (same calories = more weight gain)
- Muscle mass is lower (sarcopenia), which further slows metabolism
- Inflammation is already elevated (inflammaging + alcohol + visceral fat = compounded inflammation)
- Sleep quality already declining (age-related changes + alcohol = severe sleep deprivation)

## The Successful Aging Angle

Metabolic health is foundational to maintaining independence, energy, and physical capacity. You can't maintain muscle mass with chronic insulin resistance. You can't have energy without efficient fat burning. You can't stay mobile and active with excess visceral fat driving inflammation.

Alcohol sabotages metabolism in multiple ways:
- Blocks fat burning (liver prioritizes alcohol clearance)
- 7 cal/g, calorie-dense, zero nutrition
- May dysregulate appetite hormones
- Drives visceral fat accumulation through sleep disruption, cortisol elevation, and insulin resistance

And these aren't abstract, long-term risks. These are immediate, measurable consequences.

Persistent abdominal fat is often driven by alcohol: it blocks fat oxidation and sleep disruption drives insulin resistance.

The pre-diabetes diagnosis? That may be insulin resistance from chronic alcohol consumption and visceral fat accumulation.

The constant hunger despite eating enough? That could be alcohol dysregulating your appetite hormones.

All of it is connected. All of it may be driven by alcohol. Much of it is reversible.

Stop drinking, and within weeks:
- Fat oxidation resumes (liver is no longer prioritizing alcohol clearance)
- Weight may stabilize or drop
- Insulin sensitivity may improve
- Appetite regulation may normalize
- Inflammation drops (less visceral fat, better sleep, lower cortisol)

This isn't theory. This is what research shows happens when we remove the toxin and let our bodies heal.

## Key takeaways (scan)

- Alcohol blocks fat oxidation (liver prioritizes alcohol clearance)
- 7 cal/g, nearly as calorie-dense as fat, zero nutrition
- May dysregulate appetite (increases ghrelin, decreases leptin sensitivity)
- Sleep disruption → cortisol → insulin resistance → visceral fat accumulation
- Visceral fat secretes inflammatory cytokines (compounding inflammation from Chapter 1)
- After 60: slower baseline metabolism, lower muscle mass, higher inflammation, worse sleep
- Creates potential vicious cycle: alcohol → poor sleep → cortisol → insulin resistance → visceral fat → inflammation → worse insulin resistance → more fat storage
- Much of this may be reversible: stop drinking, fat oxidation resumes, weight stabilizes, insulin sensitivity improves, appetite regulation normalizes, inflammation drops

## Transition: From Weight to Sexual Function

We've covered how alcohol drives weight gain through empty calories, blocked fat oxidation, disrupted sleep, elevated cortisol, and insulin resistance. The visceral fat that accumulates secretes inflammatory cytokines, feeding back into the chronic inflammation we covered in Chapter 1.

But alcohol's metabolic and hormonal disruption doesn't stop with weight. The same mechanisms that drive insulin resistance and cortisol elevation also affect sex hormones. The inflammation that drives weight gain also damages blood vessels needed for sexual function. The sleep disruption that drives belly fat also suppresses testosterone production.

Alcohol undermines sexual function through multiple interconnected pathways. And after 60, when sexual function is already being challenged, alcohol's effects become impossible to ignore.

Let's talk about the performance paradox.
