# The 90-Day Operations Plan

> **The Phase:** Stabilization
> **The Goal:** New Baseline

You survived the extraction. Now we build the base.
90 days is the magic number. It takes 90 days for the liver to regenerate, the dopamine receptors to upregulate, and the habit loops to rewrite.

## Days 15-30: The Physical Rebuild

**The Focus:** The Machine.
Your energy is back. Use it.

*   **Protocol:**
    *   **Training:** Hit the weights 3x a week. Ruck 2x a week.
    *   **Fuel:** Hit your protein targets every day.
    *   **Sleep:** Lock in the 3-2-1 protocol.

**The Trap:** The "Pink Cloud." You feel invincible. You over-commit. You start a business, a marathon, and a remodel.
**The Fix:** Slow down. Stability is the goal. Don't burnout.

## Days 31-60: The Mental Upgrade

**The Focus:** The Mind.
The brain fog is gone. You are sharp.

*   **Protocol:**
    *   **Deep Work:** Use your mornings for high-leverage tasks.
    *   **Learning:** Start the "Learner Mission" (Chapter 6). Read the hard books.
    *   **Stoicism:** Practice the "Stoic Pause." Regulate your reactions.

**The Trap:** Boredom. The drama of drinking is gone. Life feels "routine."
**The Fix:** Routine is where high-performers live. Embrace the boring.

## Days 61-90: The Social Re-Entry

**The Focus:** The Tribe.
You are stable. Now you can be useful.

*   **Protocol:**
    *   **The Crew:** Reach out to the allies. Plan the hike. Plan the dinner.
    *   **The Test:** Go to a social event. Order the soda water. Realize nobody cares.
    *   **The Patriarch:** Show up for your family with full presence.

**The Trap:** "I'm cured." You think you can handle a beer at the BBQ.
**The Fix:** Re-read Chapter 1. The math hasn't changed.

## The 90-Day Review

At Day 90, do an audit.
*   Look at your face in the mirror (compare to Day 1).
*   Look at your bank account.
*   Look at your sleep data.
*   Look at your relationships.

The data will be undeniable.
You are a different man.

## Summary
*   Month 1: Build the Body.
*   Month 2: Sharpen the Mind.
*   Month 3: Lead the Tribe.
