# 30/60/90-Day Plan (Sober Lit Build)

> Phased, gentle progression; supportive tone. Adjust pacing as needed.

## Phase 0 (Days 0–7): Audit & Remove
- Log when/why you drink; note triggers (HALT+Thirst/Stress).
- Clear alcohol from easy reach; stock NA options and hydration plan.
- Add evening wind-down (no alcohol): see `solutions_sleep_ritual.md`.
- Start daily hydration targets; anchor morning/midday glasses.
- Move daily (walk + 3–5 min balance); 1–2 strength sessions.

## Phase 1 (Days 8–30): Replace & Stabilize
- Alcohol-free: use trigger→swap table (`solutions_hydration_substitutes.md`); social scripts for events.
- Movement: follow starter week (`solutions_movement.md`); 2–3 strength, balance daily, walking most days.
- Sleep: stick to routine; track subjective sleep/energy.
- Social: schedule 1–2 alcohol-free socials/week (coffee/walk/game/book club).
- Mindset: morning/evening affirmation; note wins daily.

## Phase 2 (Days 31–60): Build Capacity
- Maintain alcohol-free; review triggers weekly.
- Progress movement (longer walks, add load to strength); keep balance work.
- Nutrition/hydration: hit protein; keep hydration; add electrolytes as needed.
- Social: one “anchor” event/week (movement + social); refine scripts.
- Track: simple log (mood/sleep/energy).

## Phase 3 (Days 61–90): Deepen & Prevent
- Solidify routines; plan for known risk dates/events.
- Add a new hobby/learning block; consider volunteering/team activity.
- Relationships: proactive time with partner/family/grandkids; sober presence.
- Review: monthly check-in; adjust affirmations; plan maintenance.

## Maintenance (post-90)
- Monthly reflection: sleep, mood, energy, social, movement; adjust goals.
- Keep NA/trigger swaps handy; keep scripts fresh.
- Relapse plan: if a slip happens, pause; hydrate; eat; sleep; move lightly; revisit triggers and swap plan; recommit next day. No guilt spirals—treat it as data and resume.
