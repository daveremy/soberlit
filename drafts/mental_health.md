# Mental Health: Anxiety, Mood, and the Rebound Trap

> Problem framing; keep solutions for later.

Alcohol feels like a quick relaxant, but the rebound is wired in: as blood alcohol falls, cortisol and excitatory systems rise, feeding next-day anxiety and low mood. Over time, higher alcohol use predicts more depression and anxiety—not less.

## Key points
- Meta/review (Boden & Fergusson 2011): AUD roughly doubles adjusted odds of major depression (pooled AOR ~2.0–2.09); strongest causal path appears AUD → depression. Heavier use means higher risk.
- Bidirectional link: low mood/anxiety can drive drinking; drinking then worsens mood via rebound and sleep disruption.
- Rebound anxiety after drinking is common, even at moderate levels.
- Sleep disruption (REM/SWS suppression, fragmentation) amplifies next-day anxiety/mood symptoms.
- Anxiety/phobic disorder is associated with alcohol use disorder (meta-analysis, Lees et al., Lancet Psychiatry 2020: OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.35–2.78); supports bidirectional link; use cautiously for causality.

## Takeaways (scan)
- Alcohol is a short sedative with a longer anxiety/mood cost.
- Higher use → higher later depression/anxiety risk (pooled ~1.2–1.6×).
- Rebound anxiety + sleep loss create a cycle that keeps people drinking.
