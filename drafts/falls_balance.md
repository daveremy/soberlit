# Falls, Balance, and Injury Risk (60+ focus)

Acute alcohol impairs balance, slows reaction time, and adds sedation—at ages when baseline fall risk is already elevated by osteopenia, weaker proprioception, and meds. Meta data show a steep dose-response: non-motor vehicle injury OR increases ~1.30 (95% CI 1.26–1.34) per +10 g alcohol on an occasion, reaching ~24 at 140 g; motor vehicle OR ~1.24 (1.18–1.31) per +10 g ([Taylor2010]). Even “moderate” intoxication roughly doubles fall/injury odds; higher doses push risk further.

## Key points
- Acute alcohol ≈2x fall/injury odds at moderate intoxication; per +10 g alcohol occasion ORs ~1.24–1.30, reaching very high odds at heavier single-occasion doses ([Taylor2010]).
- Older adults have higher baseline fall risk (balance, vision, neuropathy, sarcopenia) and more fragile bones—so the same impairment yields more fractures/hip injuries.
- Fracture meta-analysis ([Ke2023]): highest vs lowest alcohol → hip fracture RR 1.20 (1.03–1.40); total fracture RR 1.26; +6% total fracture risk per +14 g/day.
- Sedating meds + alcohol further slow reflexes and deepen postural sway.

## The Successful Aging Angle

Balance and mobility are your freedom passes after 60—they determine whether you can hike trails, dance at weddings, play with grandkids, or travel confidently. Alcohol steals that freedom by doubling fall risk even at "moderate" levels. Every alcohol-free day is a vote for **independence and confidence in your body**. Better balance means saying yes to adventures instead of calculating risk. It means staying in your own home, on your own terms, for as long as you choose ([RoweKahn1997] successful aging: maintaining high physical function enables engagement with life).

## Takeaways (scan)
- Short-term drinking is tightly linked to fall injuries; dose matters.
- Compounding factors in 60+: weaker balance, slower reflexes, osteopenia → more severe consequences.
- Sedative meds + alcohol magnify fall risk.
