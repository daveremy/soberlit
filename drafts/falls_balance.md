# Audit 6: Stability (Falls & Balance)

> **The Mechanism:** Cerebellar Impairment & Sarcopenia
> **The Cost:** Your Independence

This chapter isn't about "falling down like a drunk."
It's about **Athleticism**.

As men, we pride ourselves on physical capability. The ability to move, lift, climb, and stand our ground.

Alcohol attacks the very system that keeps you upright.

## The Proprioception Hit

Proprioception is your body's ability to know where it is in space. It’s what lets you walk on uneven ground without looking at your feet.

Alcohol numbs the cerebellum—the part of the brain that controls coordination and balance.
Even "moderate" chronic drinking degrades this system.

You become... slightly clumsy. A little slower to react. A little less sure on the hiking trail. A little more likely to grab the railing.

You blame it on "aging."
It’s not just aging. It’s the chemical you are marinating your cerebellum in.

## The Fracture Risk

Let's be brutal.
At 30, a fall is embarrassing.
At 70, a fall is a **Mortality Event**.

A hip fracture changes the trajectory of your life. It leads to hospitalization, muscle atrophy (from bed rest), and often pneumonia. The mortality rate within one year of a hip fracture for men over 60 is terrifying.

Alcohol doubles your risk of injury (Taylor et al., 2010). Not just because you are tipsy, but because:
1.  **Bones:** Alcohol creates osteopenia (thinner bones).
2.  **Reflexes:** It slows the reaction time needed to catch yourself.

## The Integrated Man Angle: Athleticism

You want to be the guy who can hike the Grand Canyon at 70. The guy who can ski. The guy who can chase the dog.

Balance and coordination are "use it or lose it" skills. Alcohol accelerates the "lose it."

Every day you train sober (balance exercises, walking, lifting), you are banking **stability**. You are hardening the target.

Don't be the guy who gets taken out by a rug because his reflexes were dulled by Merlot.
