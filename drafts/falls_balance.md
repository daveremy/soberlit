# Falls, Balance, and Injury Risk (60+ focus)


Acute alcohol impairs balance, slows reaction time, and adds sedation—at ages when baseline fall risk is already elevated by osteopenia, weaker proprioception, and meds. Meta data show a steep dose-response: non-motor vehicle injury OR increases ~1.30 (95% CI 1.26–1.34) per +10 g alcohol on an occasion, reaching ~24 at 140 g; motor vehicle OR ~1.24 (1.18–1.31) per +10 g ([Taylor2010]). Even “moderate” intoxication roughly doubles fall/injury odds; higher doses push risk further.

## Key points
- Acute alcohol ≈2x fall/injury odds at moderate intoxication; per +10 g alcohol occasion ORs ~1.24–1.30, reaching very high odds at heavier single-occasion doses ([Taylor2010]).
- Older adults have higher baseline fall risk (balance, vision, neuropathy, sarcopenia) and more fragile bones—so the same impairment yields more fractures/hip injuries.
- Fracture meta-analysis ([Ke2023]): highest vs lowest alcohol → hip fracture RR 1.20 (1.03–1.40); total fracture RR 1.26; +6% total fracture risk per +14 g/day.
- Sedating meds + alcohol further slow reflexes and deepen postural sway.

## The Successful Aging Angle

Balance and mobility determine quality of life after 60—whether we can hike trails, dance at weddings, play with grandkids, or travel confidently. Alcohol compromises this independence by doubling fall risk even at "moderate" levels. Every alcohol-free day is an investment in **independence and confidence in our bodies**. Better balance means saying yes to adventures instead of calculating risk. It means staying in our own homes, on our own terms, for as long as we choose ([RoweKahn1997] successful aging: maintaining high physical function enables engagement with life).

## Takeaways (scan)
- Short-term drinking is tightly linked to fall injuries; dose matters.
- Compounding factors in 60+: weaker balance, slower reflexes, osteopenia → more severe consequences.
- Sedative meds + alcohol magnify fall risk.

## Transition: From Falls to Medication Interactions

Falls don't happen in isolation. Alcohol impairs balance directly, but it also **compounds** the effects of medications many of us are taking—sleeping pills, blood pressure medications, pain relievers. That combination creates a sedation cascade that turns manageable risk into hip fracture.

This isn't unique to sleeping pills. If we're over 60, we're likely taking **multiple medications**: blood pressure pills, blood thinners, diabetes meds, pain relievers, antidepressants. And alcohol interacts dangerously with nearly all of them—raising bleeding risk, crashing blood pressure, triggering hypoglycemia, deepening sedation to the point of respiratory depression.

Polypharmacy + alcohol isn't just risky. It's a contributing factor to ER visits, falls, and life-threatening complications. Let's look at the specific dangers.
