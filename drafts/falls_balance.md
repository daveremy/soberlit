# Falls, Balance, and Injury Risk (60+ focus)

> Problem framing only; keep solutions for later chapters.

Acute alcohol impairs balance, slows reaction time, and adds sedation—at ages when baseline fall risk is already elevated by osteopenia, weaker proprioception, and meds. Meta data show a steep dose-response: non-motor vehicle injury OR increases ~1.30 (95% CI 1.26–1.34) per +10 g alcohol on an occasion, reaching ~24 at 140 g; motor vehicle OR ~1.24 (1.18–1.31) per +10 g ([Taylor2010]). Even “moderate” intoxication roughly doubles fall/injury odds; higher doses push risk further.

## Key points
- Acute alcohol ≈2x fall/injury odds at moderate intoxication; per +10 g alcohol occasion ORs ~1.24–1.30, reaching very high odds at heavier single-occasion doses ([Taylor2010]).
- Older adults have higher baseline fall risk (balance, vision, neuropathy, sarcopenia) and more fragile bones—so the same impairment yields more fractures/hip injuries.
- Fracture meta-analysis ([Ke2023]): highest vs lowest alcohol → hip fracture RR 1.20 (1.03–1.40); total fracture RR 1.26; +6% total fracture risk per +14 g/day.
- Sedating meds + alcohol further slow reflexes and deepen postural sway.

### 📦 Meet Dorothy, 71 (Retired Librarian & Hip Fracture Survivor)

**Before:**
Dorothy retired at 68. Active, independent, lived alone in a two-story house. Evening routine: two glasses of wine with dinner, sometimes more on weekends. "It helps me sleep," she said. About 14-20 drinks per week. She took a beta-blocker for mild hypertension and a sleeping pill (zolpidem) a few nights a week.

One evening (age 70), Dorothy had three glasses of wine at a friend's birthday dinner. Came home around 9 PM, took her sleeping pill, headed upstairs to bed. Missed the second-to-last step. Fell backward, landed on her right hip. Couldn't get up. Crawled to the phone, called 911.

Diagnosis: fractured right hip (femoral neck). Surgery the next day (hip replacement). Six weeks non-weight-bearing. Three months of physical therapy. Never fully regained her confidence on stairs.

**The Data:**
Dorothy's fall wasn't "just bad luck." Taylor et al. (2010) meta-analysis shows acute alcohol roughly doubles injury odds even at moderate intoxication. The combination of alcohol + sleeping pill (both CNS depressants) profoundly magnifies fall risk—slower reflexes, deeper sedation, impaired postural control.

Ke et al. (2023) fracture meta-analysis: highest vs lowest alcohol intake → hip fracture RR 1.20 (1.03–1.40). Dorothy's pattern (2-3 drinks/day) put her in that elevated-risk range. At 70, she also had osteopenia (bone density T-score -1.8)—so the same fall that causes a bruise at 30 causes a fracture at 70.

**After (18 months alcohol-free):**
Dorothy quit alcohol completely after the fall. "I'm not doing that again."

**Month 1-3 (Recovery):** Non-weight-bearing, walker, physical therapy. No alcohol (she was on pain meds, couldn't mix). Sleep was terrible without the wine + sleeping pill combo, but she worked with her doctor to taper the sleeping pill safely.

**Month 4-6:** Walking with a cane. PT progressing. Sleep improving (took 3 months to stabilize). Doctor cleared her to stop the sleeping pill entirely. "Your sleep architecture will be better without it."

**Month 12:** Walking without a cane. Stairs still scary, but manageable. Bone density scan: T-score improved to -1.4 (still osteopenia, but better). Doctor: "Stopping alcohol helps—it's toxic to bone remodeling."

**Month 18:** Fully independent. Walks daily. Doing strength training (recommended by PT to prevent future falls). Confidence back. "I'm not afraid of my own stairs anymore."

**Her takeaway:**
"I thought wine was helping me sleep. It wasn't—it was setting me up to fall and break my hip. The combination of alcohol + sleeping pill was a disaster waiting to happen. The fall took a year of my life—surgery, recovery, fear, loss of independence. I was lucky it wasn't worse. Hip fractures kill 20-30% of people my age within a year (not from the fracture, but from the cascade—pneumonia, blood clots, decline). I'm not gambling with that again. My independence is worth more than a glass of wine."

## The Successful Aging Angle

Balance and mobility are your freedom passes after 60—they determine whether you can hike trails, dance at weddings, play with grandkids, or travel confidently. Alcohol steals that freedom by doubling fall risk even at "moderate" levels. Every alcohol-free day is a vote for **independence and confidence in your body**. Better balance means saying yes to adventures instead of calculating risk. It means staying in your own home, on your own terms, for as long as you choose ([RoweKahn1997] successful aging: maintaining high physical function enables engagement with life).

## Takeaways (scan)
- Short-term drinking is tightly linked to fall injuries; dose matters.
- Compounding factors in 60+: weaker balance, slower reflexes, osteopenia → more severe consequences.
- Sedative meds + alcohol magnify fall risk.

## Transition: From Falls to Medication Interactions

Dorothy's story highlighted something critical: alcohol didn't just impair her balance—it **compounded** the effects of her sleeping pill, creating a sedation cascade that made the fall inevitable. That single detail—mixing wine with a benzodiazepine-like drug—turned a manageable risk into a hip fracture.

This isn't unique to sleeping pills. If you're over 60, you're likely taking **multiple medications**: blood pressure pills, blood thinners, diabetes meds, pain relievers, antidepressants. And alcohol interacts dangerously with nearly all of them—raising bleeding risk, crashing blood pressure, triggering hypoglycemia, deepening sedation to the point of respiratory depression.

Polypharmacy + alcohol isn't just risky. It's a hidden accelerator of ER visits, falls, and life-threatening complications. Let's look at the specific dangers.
