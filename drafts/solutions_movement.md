# Movement Starter (for Non-Athletes)

> Simple, joint-friendly, buildable; clear cautions to consult clinician if needed.

## Why move
- Strength, balance, and walking volume cut fall risk, support BP, mood, and sleep—without alcohol’s downsides.

## Safety first
- If you have cardiac, joint, or balance issues, check with your clinician before changes.
- Start low; add slowly; stop if pain (not just effort) spikes.

## Core pillars
- **Walking:** aim for daily; start where you are; add 5–10 minutes or steps per week.
- **Strength 2–3x/week:** bodyweight/chair-friendly: sit-to-stand, wall push-ups, carries (light bags), step-ups.
- **Balance 3–5 min/day:** single-leg stand near support; tandem stand/walk; heel-to-toe; gentle yoga/tai chi moves.
- **Mobility:** gentle stretches for hips/ankles/shoulders after warm-up.

## Starter week (example)
- Mon/Thu: strength circuit 2–3 rounds: 8–12 sit-to-stands, 8–12 wall push-ups, 30–60s carry, 8–12 step-ups/leg; finish with 3–5 min balance.
- Tue/Fri: 20–30 min walk (or split into 2 x 10–15 min); add 5 min each week as tolerated.
- Wed/Sat: balance + mobility (5–10 min); optional light walk.
- Sun: easy walk or rest.

## Movement as a craving/stress response
- Do 5–10 minutes: brisk walk, 1–2 sets of sit-to-stands/wall push-ups/carries, or stair repeats. It shifts state, burns off stress, and interrupts urges.
- Low motivation? Use the five-minute rule: start for five minutes; you can stop after, but often you’ll continue once moving.
- Pair with hydration/urge first-aid from `solutions_hydration_substitutes.md` when an urge hits.

## Progressions
- Add load (light dumbbells/backpack) to sit-to-stands/carries.
- Increase walk duration/pace gradually.
- Extend balance holds; add head turns or softer surface when steady.

## Tips
- Pair sessions with a cue (after breakfast); track with a simple log.
- Hydrate; fuel with protein/food—don’t train fasted if it makes you lightheaded.
