# Toolkit 2: Training — Building the Armor

> **The Goal:** Utility and Independence
> **The Tactic:** Heavy Carries and Rucking

We are not "exercising" to burn calories. We are **training** to build a chassis that can handle the next 20 years.
The enemy is **Fragility**. The antidote is **Load**.

## The Integrated Man Protocol

This is not a bodybuilding split. This is a survival kit.

### 1. The Heavy Carry (The Patriarch Lift)
**Why:** It builds grip, traps, core, and mental grit. It mimics the real-world utility of carrying luggage, groceries, or a grandchild.
**The Move:** Farmer's Walk.
*   Pick up two heavy dumbbells (or kettlebells).
*   Walk 50 yards.
*   Put them down.
*   Repeat 3 times.
**Standard:** Carry 50% of your bodyweight (total).

### 2. The Ruck (The Engine Builder)
**Why:** Running destroys knees. Walking is too easy. Rucking (walking with weight) burns 3x the calories of walking, builds bone density, and fixes posture.
**The Move:** Rucking.
*   Put 20-30 lbs in a backpack (or buy a rucking plate).
*   Walk for 30-45 minutes.
*   Keep a pace where you can talk, but you'd rather not.

### 3. The Squat (The Independence Lift)
**Why:** If you can't squat, you can't get off the toilet alone. Leg strength is the #1 predictor of independence.
**The Move:** Goblet Squat.
*   Hold one weight at your chest.
*   Sit back like you're sitting in a chair.
*   Stand up.
*   Do 3 sets of 10.

### 4. The Get-Up (The Life Saver)
**Why:** Falls kill. The ability to get off the floor is a survival skill.
**The Move:** The Turkish Get-Up (or simply: "Get Down, Get Up").
*   Lie on your back.
*   Stand up without using your hands (if possible).
*   Lie back down.
*   Repeat 5 times.

## The Schedule

*   **Monday:** Strength (Carries, Squats, Pushups).
*   **Tuesday:** Ruck (30 min).
*   **Wednesday:** Strength.
*   **Thursday:** Ruck.
*   **Friday:** Strength.
*   **Saturday:** Long Ruck or Hike (60+ min).
*   **Sunday:** Mobility / Rest.

## Summary
*   Don't run; Ruck.
*   Don't curl; Carry.
*   Train for the 90-year-old you.
