# Foreword: The Systems Audit

I didn't go looking for a guru. I went looking for an exit.

I am a systems guy. I spent 30 years in tech, building complex architectures, scaling companies, and solving problems that cost millions of dollars. I lived by the **Outer Scorecard**: the title, the exit, the house, the status. By all accounts, I had won.

But at 62, I was drifting.
The structure of work was gone. The "Commander" identity had dissolved.
My evenings had become a blur of wine, Netflix, and a vague, gnawing sense of irrelevance.
I told myself I was "relaxing." I told myself I deserved it.

But the data didn't lie.
I tracked my sleep. Garbage.
I checked my blood pressure. Creeping up.
I looked at my game—on the pickleball court, where I pride myself on a solid 4.5 rating—and I was slipping.

I wasn't crashing. I was just... dimming.

So I did what I always do: I ran an audit.
I treated my body and my life like a failing codebase. I looked for the bugs. I looked for the memory leaks. I looked for the friction points.

One variable stood out. It was the one variable I protected the most. The one I called "my reward."
Alcohol.

This book is not a memoir of addiction. I wasn't waking up in gutters. I was a "successful" drinker.
This book is an engineering manual. It is the result of a deep-dive investigation into the mechanics of aging, physiology, and performance.

I wrote this for myself—to lock in the lessons, to secure my 5.0 rating, and to ensure I never drift again.
If you are reading this, maybe you are drifting too.
Maybe you are ready to debug the system.

Let's look at the code.
