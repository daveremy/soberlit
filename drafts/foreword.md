# Foreword (Personal Intent)

I’m writing this for me—my life, now. I see how alcohol has woven into retired routines, and I want to face its real effects, dismantle the myths, and build a Sober Lit life. This isn’t abstract research; it’s my own map to clarity, energy, and presence.

The evidence is here so I can track it: every claim ties to a study, cohort, or guideline. The GitHub repo holds the full trail if I—or anyone else—wants to go down the rabbit hole. Appendix references are annotated so they’re readable, not just citation lists.

If this eventually helps others, great. For now, it’s my handbook: understanding the situation, seeing the costs and myths clearly, and laying the groundwork for living lit without alcohol.***
