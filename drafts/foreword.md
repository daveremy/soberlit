# Foreword (Personal Intent)

I’m writing this for me—my life, now. I see how alcohol has woven into retired routines, and I want to face its real effects, dismantle the myths, and build a Sober Lit life. This isn’t abstract research; it’s my own map to clarity, energy, and presence.

Underneath, this is a book about successful aging. It’s about keeping goals even when “retired,” envisioning the rest of my life—including the end—and choosing to live at a vibrant frequency with connection, purpose, and joy. Alcohol doesn’t serve that vision; it dulls it. The plan here is to become unfuckwithable about that choice: even if alcohol is around and no one is looking, I wouldn’t pick it, because I can meet my real needs directly.

The evidence is here so I can track it: every claim ties to a study, cohort, or guideline. The GitHub repo holds the full trail if I—or anyone else—wants to go down the rabbit hole. Appendix references are annotated so they’re readable, not just citation lists.

If this eventually helps others, great. For now, it’s my handbook: understanding the situation, seeing the costs and myths clearly, and laying the groundwork for living lit without alcohol.***
