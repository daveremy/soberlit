# Foreword (Personal Intent)

I'm writing this for me—my life, now. I see how alcohol has woven into retired routines, and I want to face its real effects, dismantle the myths, and build a Sober Lit life. This isn't abstract research; it's my own map to clarity, energy, and presence.

Underneath, this is a book about successful aging. It's about keeping goals even when "retired," envisioning the rest of my life—including the end—and choosing to live at a vibrant frequency with connection, purpose, and joy. Alcohol doesn't serve that vision; it dulls it. The plan here is to become unfuckwithable about that choice: even if alcohol is around and no one is looking, I wouldn't pick it, because I can meet my real needs directly.

The evidence is here so I can track it: every claim ties to a study, cohort, or guideline. The GitHub repo holds the full trail if I—or anyone else—wants to go down the rabbit hole. Appendix references are annotated so they're readable, not just citation lists.

## Who This Book Is For

This book is for **health-conscious adults over 60** who are:
- Drinking regularly (daily wine, cocktails at dinner, "wine o'clock") and sensing it might be time for a change
- Seeing the headlines about alcohol risks and wondering what the real data says
- Optimizing for successful aging—energy, clarity, mobility, presence—not managing a disease
- Looking for evidence-based guidance, not recovery programs or support groups
- Making a choice from conviction, not because you "have to"

**This is NOT a clinical treatment book.** If you're experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms, medical complications from alcohol, or need supervised detoxification, please consult a healthcare provider. This book assumes you can stop drinking safely on your own and are looking for the "why" and "how" to make that choice stick.

If you're reading this, you're likely where I am: retired or semi-retired, health-aware, tired of the daily habit, and ready to see what life looks like alcohol-free. This isn't about recovery—it's about **thriving**.

If this eventually helps others, great. For now, it's my handbook: understanding the situation, seeing the costs and myths clearly, and laying the groundwork for living lit without alcohol.***
