# Brain Health, Dementia, and Sleep (60+ focus)

Clear thinking, memory, and restorative sleep are huge quality-of-life levers after 60. Alcohol nudges all three in the wrong direction: higher dementia risk with regular intake, measurable brain structure changes at “moderate” levels, and choppy, less restorative sleep. The good news: these risks are modifiable—your brain and sleep improve when alcohol comes down.

Use this section to normalize making brain/sleep protection a priority: alcohol isn’t needed for relaxation; it quietly taxes memory and sleep depth.

## Cognition & Dementia
Hippocampal atrophy shows up at “moderate” intake: in Topiwala et al. 2017 (mean age mid-60s), 14–21 UK units/week had OR 3.4 (1.4–8.1) for right hippocampal atrophy; >30 units/week OR 5.8 (1.8–18.6); “no protective effect of light drinking (1–<7 units/week) over abstinence.” Dementia risk rises with higher intake: Sabia et al. 2018 (23-year follow-up) found >14 units/week carried ~17% higher dementia risk (95% CI 4–32%) vs 1–14; abstinence HR 1.47 (1.15–1.89) vs 1–14, partly due to cardiometabolic illness (sick-quitter issue). Takeaway: keep intake low or none; don’t bank on “moderate protects.” Coach angle: “My brain likes clarity. Keeping alcohol near zero protects memory, balance, and presence.”

## Sleep Myth Box: “Alcohol helps me sleep”
Alcohol shortens sleep latency but suppresses REM/SWS in the first half of the night and causes rebound wake/fragmentation in the second half. Evening doses ~0.5–1.0 g/kg reduce REM time over the night (e.g., 0.5 g/kg in human PSG reduced REM across 8 hours in Roehrs et al. 1999) and lower HRV, with more arousals later. You fall asleep faster but wake earlier, lose restorative REM/deep sleep, and feel less recovered. Coach angle: “For real rest, swap the nightcap for a wind-down ritual—tea, breath pacing, dim light.”

## The Successful Aging Angle

Neuroplasticity doesn't stop at 60. Your brain is ready to learn new languages, hobbies, and patterns *right now*—but it needs high-quality fuel ([Thuret2015]: adults can grow new neurons throughout life; alcohol suppresses neurogenesis, exercise and learning promote it). Alcohol is sugar in the gas tank. Every drink you skip is an investment in sharper memory, deeper sleep, and more presence with the people and activities you love. The best part? You'll feel the clarity gains within weeks, not years ([RoweKahn1997] successful aging: maintaining high cognitive function is a modifiable pillar, not inevitable decline).

## Key takeaways (scan)
- "Moderate" intake (14–21 units/week) linked to hippocampal atrophy; heavier is worse.
- Dementia risk climbs above low intake; sick-quitter bias explains abstainer signal.
- Alcohol fragments sleep: less REM/deep sleep, more wakefulness later in the night.
- Best for brain and sleep: keep alcohol near zero; build a non-alcohol wind-down.
