# Brain Health, Dementia, and Sleep (60+ focus)

> Tone: supportive/coach-like; use the logged study numbers.

Clear thinking, memory, and restorative sleep are huge quality-of-life levers after 60. Alcohol nudges all three in the wrong direction: higher dementia risk with regular intake, measurable brain structure changes at “moderate” levels, and choppy, less restorative sleep. The good news: these risks are modifiable—your brain and sleep improve when alcohol comes down.

Use this section to normalize making brain/sleep protection a priority: alcohol isn’t needed for relaxation; it quietly taxes memory and sleep depth.

## Cognition & Dementia
Hippocampal atrophy shows up at “moderate” intake: in Topiwala et al. 2017 (mean age mid-60s), 14–21 UK units/week had OR 3.4 (1.4–8.1) for right hippocampal atrophy; >30 units/week OR 5.8 (1.8–18.6); “no protective effect of light drinking (1–<7 units/week) over abstinence.” Dementia risk rises with higher intake: Sabia et al. 2018 (23-year follow-up) found >14 units/week carried ~17% higher dementia risk (95% CI 4–32%) vs 1–14; abstinence HR 1.47 (1.15–1.89) vs 1–14, partly due to cardiometabolic illness (sick-quitter issue). Takeaway: keep intake low or none; don’t bank on “moderate protects.” Coach angle: “My brain likes clarity. Keeping alcohol near zero protects memory, balance, and presence.”

## Sleep Myth Box: “Alcohol helps me sleep”
Alcohol shortens sleep latency but suppresses REM/SWS in the first half of the night and causes rebound wake/fragmentation in the second half. Evening doses ~0.5–1.0 g/kg reduce REM time over the night (e.g., 0.5 g/kg in human PSG reduced REM across 8 hours in Roehrs et al. 1999) and lower HRV, with more arousals later. You fall asleep faster but wake earlier, lose restorative REM/deep sleep, and feel less recovered. Coach angle: “For real rest, swap the nightcap for a wind-down ritual—tea, breath pacing, dim light.”

## The Successful Aging Angle

Neuroplasticity doesn't stop at 60. Your brain is ready to learn new languages, hobbies, and patterns *right now*—but it needs high-quality fuel ([Thuret2015]: adults can grow new neurons throughout life; alcohol suppresses neurogenesis, exercise and learning promote it). Alcohol is sugar in the gas tank. Every drink you skip is an investment in sharper memory, deeper sleep, and more presence with the people and activities you love. The best part? You'll feel the clarity gains within weeks, not years ([RoweKahn1997] successful aging: maintaining high cognitive function is a modifiable pillar, not inevitable decline).

### 📦 Meet Tom, 68 (Retired Software Engineer)

**Before:**
Tom retired from a 40-year career in tech at 65. Sharp guy—built systems, managed teams, solved complex problems. But by 67, he noticed something was off. He'd start a sentence and lose the thread. Names wouldn't come. He'd walk into a room and forget why. "Senior moments," he called them. "Just part of getting older."

His drinking pattern: Two glasses of wine most nights (sometimes three), craft beer on weekends. "Moderate," by any standard. Around 14-18 units per week.

Sleep was terrible. He'd fall asleep fine (the wine helped, he thought), but wake at 2 AM, 4 AM, sometimes both. Groggy every morning. Needed two cups of coffee to feel human. "Getting older," he figured.

**The Data:**
Tom's pattern—14-18 units/week—falls right in the "moderate" range that Topiwala et al. (2017) linked to hippocampal atrophy. OR 3.4 for right hippocampal shrinkage at 14-21 units/week. The hippocampus = memory formation, spatial navigation, learning. Tom's "senior moments" weren't normal aging—they were alcohol-induced brain changes.

His fragmented sleep: classic alcohol sleep architecture disruption. Alcohol suppresses REM in the first half of the night, causes rebound waking in the second half ([Walker2017]). Tom was getting 6-7 hours in bed but maybe 4-5 hours of actual restorative sleep.

**After (4 months alcohol-free):**
Tom quit alcohol to "see what happens." Not because he hit rock bottom—because he read the research and didn't like what he saw.

**Week 1-2:** Sleep still bad (withdrawal effects). Waking up even more. "This is supposed to be better?"

**Week 3-4:** Sleep consolidating. Waking once instead of 2-3 times. Mornings less groggy.

**Month 2:** "I'm dreaming again. Vivid, memorable dreams. I haven't had those in years." REM sleep returning.

**Month 3-4:** Memory noticeably sharper. "I'm following complex technical discussions again. I'm learning new programming languages (picked up Rust for fun). I'm remembering people's names. The 'senior moments' are... gone."

Sleep: 7.5-8 hours solid, waking 0-1 times per night. Energy all day. No afternoon crash.

**His takeaway:**
"I thought moderate drinking was fine. I'm a data person—I trust studies, not anecdotes. But when I looked at the actual research, the case was clear: even 'moderate' drinking was shrinking my hippocampus and wrecking my sleep. I thought I was just getting old. Turns out, I was getting drunk—slowly, every night, just enough to dim my brain without realizing it.

Four months in, I'm sharper than I was at 65. My brain is working *better* now than it did two years ago. That's not supposed to be possible, right? But neuroplasticity is real. Remove the toxin, give your brain what it needs, and it bounces back. I didn't realize how foggy I was until the fog lifted."

## Key takeaways (scan)
- "Moderate" intake (14–21 units/week) linked to hippocampal atrophy; heavier is worse.
- Dementia risk climbs above low intake; sick-quitter bias explains abstainer signal.
- Alcohol fragments sleep: less REM/deep sleep, more wakefulness later in the night.
- Best for brain and sleep: keep alcohol near zero; build a non-alcohol wind-down.
