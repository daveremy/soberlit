# Nutrition & Supplements (Supportive, Check with Clinician)

> Focus on basics; avoid medical claims. Remind to consult a clinician, especially with meds/conditions.

## Fundamentals
- Eat protein at each meal (aim ~1.2–1.6 g/kg/day if tolerated; adjust per clinician), especially helpful for preserving muscle after 60.
- Emphasize whole foods: lean proteins, beans/lentils, vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains as tolerated.
- Keep fiber and hydration up; regular meals help blunt cravings and stabilize energy.

## Supplements (talk to your clinician)
- **Creatine (3–5 g/day):** supports muscle/strength; generally safe but check kidneys/meds.
- **Vitamin D:** supplement if deficient; check levels.
- **Omega-3:** via fatty fish or supplement; watch interactions (bleed risk with anticoagulants).
- **B1 (thiamine):** consider if long-term heavy alcohol use; consult.
- **Electrolytes:** when sweating/low-carb; avoid excess sugar if glucose issues.

## Practical tips
- Plan simple, repeatable meals; batch cook.
- Pair carbs with protein/fat to reduce spikes/crashes.
- Eat before social events to reduce “hungry + trigger” overlap.
- Use hydration (see `solutions_hydration_substitutes.md`) alongside meals.
