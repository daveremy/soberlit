# Toolkit 3: Fuel — Protein and Testosterone

> **The Goal:** Metabolic Armor
> **The Tactic:** Protein Prioritization

Food is not entertainment. Food is fuel.
At 60, your margin for error is zero.
*   **Alcohol:** Poison.
*   **Sugar:** Inflammatory.
*   **Protein:** Structural.

## The Protein Imperative

You are fighting **Anabolic Resistance**.
As you age, your body becomes less efficient at turning protein into muscle. You need *more* protein just to maintain what you have.

**The Target:** 1 gram of protein per pound of *ideal* body weight.
If you want to weigh 180 lbs, you eat 180g of protein.

**Why?**
1.  **Satiety:** Protein kills cravings. If you are full of steak, you don't want wine.
2.  **Muscle:** It feeds the armor.
3.  **Thermic Effect:** It burns more calories to digest than fat or carbs.

## The Testosterone Support Protocol

You stopped drinking (which stops the estrogen conversion). Now support the T-production.

1.  **Zinc & Magnesium:** Essential for T-production.
2.  **Vitamin D3:** Most men are deficient. Get sun or supplement (5000 IU).
3.  **Cholesterol:** Your body *needs* dietary cholesterol to make testosterone. Eat the eggs (yolks included).

## The "Kill Cravings" Meal

When you want a drink at 5:00 PM, you are often just **hypoglycemic** (low blood sugar).
Alcohol is liquid sugar. Your brain wants the spike.

**The Counter-Measure:**
Eat a high-protein, high-fat snack at 4:00 PM.
*   Beef jerky.
*   Hard-boiled eggs.
*   Handful of almonds.

Stabilize the blood sugar, and the craving dissolves.

## Summary
*   Prioritize Protein (30g+ per meal).
*   Don't fear healthy fats (eggs, steak, avocado).
*   Kill the 5:00 PM craving with food, not booze.
