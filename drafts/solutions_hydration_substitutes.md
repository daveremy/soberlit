# Hydration & Substitutes (Sober Lit Tools)

> Supportive/coach-like; tie back to triggers. Keep claims modest; note that dehydration can masquerade as craving.

We choose alcohol-free by conviction, not avoidance: urges point to real needs (HALT+Thirst/Stress). Meet those directly.

## Why hydration matters
- Mild dehydration can show up as fatigue, low mood, or “craving something” and can be misattributed to alcohol desire.
- After 60, thirst cues can be blunted; medications (diuretics, some antihypertensives) can shift fluid balance.

## Hydration basics
- Target range: ~2–3 L/day (adjust for body size, heat, activity). Spread intake; front-load earlier in the day to protect sleep.
- Electrolytes: add when sweating, in heat, or if low-carb; avoid high-sugar mixes if managing glucose.
- Pair hydration with anchors: a glass on waking, mid-morning, early afternoon; lighter sips after dinner to avoid overnight waking.
- Watch meds: if on fluid restrictions or diuretics, align with your clinician.

## Urge first-aid: HALT(+T/S) → swap
| Trigger | Swap (non-alcohol) | Add-on action (state shift) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Treat | Food treat (fruit, dark chocolate, ice cream) or ritual drink (herbal tea, NA spritz with bitters/citrus) | Enjoy mindfully; short break |
| Stress | 3–5 min breath/stretch; hot/cold drink | Step outside; 5–10 min brisk walk or squats |
| Social | NA craft beer or bitters/citrus spritz in proper glass | Use prepared script; hold a glass |
| Boredom | Short activity (book/game/puzzle/learning); sparkling water with citrus | 10–15 min timer; switch tasks |
| Lonely | Text/call someone + tea/NA drink | Pair with a walk if possible |
| Thirst | Water + electrolytes (if needed) | Reassess urge after hydrating |

## Mindset and trigger check
- Use HALT (+Thirst/Stress): Hunger, Anger, Lonely, Tired, Thirsty, Stress. Assume the urge isn’t for alcohol; solve the root need (eat, hydrate, move, rest, connect).
- Pre-commit your swaps: know which drink/food/act you’ll reach for in each trigger.

## Quick starter routine
- Morning: water + electrolytes (if needed); breakfast.
- Midday: water; light activity; NA beverage if social.
- Evening: herbal tea or NA spritz; wind-down without alcohol; lighter fluids 2–3 hours before bed.
