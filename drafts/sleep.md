# Sleep: Why You Wake Up Exhausted

> Problem framing; keep solutions for later chapters.

You finish a bottle of wine by 9 PM. You fall asleep by 10. You're in bed for 7-8 hours. You should wake up refreshed.

Instead, you wake up at 2 AM. Maybe 4 AM. Heart racing. Mind spinning. Wide awake for 30 minutes, an hour, sometimes the rest of the night. When the alarm finally goes off, you feel like you got 4 hours of sleep. Because functionally, you did.

This happens every single night you drink. And if you're drinking most nights, you haven't had truly restorative sleep in years.

Alcohol is not a sleep aid. It's a sleep destroyer.

## The Myth: "Alcohol Helps Me Sleep"

This is one of the most pervasive and damaging myths about alcohol. People defend their nightly drinking with "But it helps me fall asleep!"

It does. Sort of. For about 2 hours.

Then it wrecks everything.

Here's what actually happens:

**Phase 1 (Hours 0-2): Sedation, Not Sleep**

Alcohol shortens sleep latency, the time it takes to fall asleep. You pass out faster. This feels helpful.

But sedation is not sleep. You're unconscious, but your brain is not doing the restorative work of true sleep. REM sleep (Rapid Eye Movement, the dream phase) is suppressed. Deep sleep (slow-wave sleep, SWS) is disrupted.

Roehrs et al. (1999) gave subjects ~0.5 g/kg ethanol before bed (roughly 3-4 drinks for an average adult) and measured sleep architecture using polysomnography. Result: **REM sleep was reduced across the entire 8-hour sleep period.**

You fall asleep faster, but you lose the only sleep that matters.

**Phase 2 (Hours 3-8): Rebound Wakefulness, Fragmented Sleep**

As blood alcohol drops, your body enters withdrawal. Not severe withdrawal like tremors or seizures, but enough to disrupt sleep.

Cortisol rises. Excitatory neurotransmitters (glutamate, norepinephrine) surge. Your sympathetic nervous system activates. Heart rate and body temperature increase.

You wake up. Sometimes fully awake, staring at the ceiling. Sometimes just enough to disrupt sleep cycles, you don't remember waking, but your fitness tracker does.

This is rebound wakefulness. Your body is fighting the sedative effect of alcohol with an overshoot in the opposite direction. The harder you sedate (more alcohol), the harder the rebound.

And it happens **every single time you drink before bed.**

---

**Phase 3 (Morning): Fake Sleep, Real Exhaustion**

You got 7 hours in bed. Maybe you even got 6-7 hours of what looks like sleep on a sleep tracker.

But REM sleep was suppressed in the first half. Deep sleep was fragmented. You woke multiple times (even if you don't remember). Your heart rate variability (HRV) was low all night, a sign of poor recovery.

You wake up exhausted. Groggy. Irritable. Needing two cups of coffee to feel human.

This isn't "getting older." This is alcohol-induced sleep disruption.

And if you're drinking most nights, you're chronically sleep-deprived. Not because you're not in bed long enough. Because the sleep you're getting is low-quality, fragmented, and non-restorative.

## What REM and Deep Sleep Actually Do (And Why Losing Them Matters)

Sleep isn't just "time your eyes are closed." Different stages of sleep serve different critical functions.

**REM Sleep (Dream Sleep):**
- Consolidates memories (especially emotional and procedural memories)
- Processes emotions, regulates mood
- Enhances learning and creativity
- Clears out amyloid-beta (the Alzheimer's protein) from the brain

Lose REM, and you lose memory consolidation. You can't learn new information as effectively. Emotional regulation weakens (hence irritability and mood swings). And amyloid-beta accumulates, accelerating dementia risk.

**Deep Sleep (Slow-Wave Sleep, SWS):**
- Physical restoration and repair
- Immune system function (produces cytokines, fights infection)
- Hormone regulation (growth hormone, cortisol balance)
- Glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity
- Clears metabolic waste from the brain

Lose deep sleep, and your body can't repair itself. Immune function weakens. Insulin resistance increases (hello, weight gain and diabetes risk). Inflammation stays elevated.

Alcohol robs you of both. You get sedation and light sleep, but not the restorative phases that keep you healthy.

## Heart Rate Variability: Your Body's Report Card

Heart rate variability (HRV) measures the variation in time between heartbeats. Higher HRV = better recovery, better stress resilience, better autonomic nervous system function. Lower HRV = poor recovery, high stress, sympathetic dominance (fight-or-flight mode).

Sleep should increase HRV. Your body is resting, recovering, shifting into parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) mode.

Alcohol does the opposite. Even moderate doses (~0.5-1.0 g/kg, 2-4 drinks) lower HRV during sleep. Your body is in bed, but it's not recovering. It's in low-level fight-or-flight all night.

If you track HRV with a wearable (Oura, Whoop, Apple Watch), look at your data after drinking nights vs. sober nights. The difference is stark. Alcohol nights show lower HRV, higher resting heart rate, and lower recovery scores.

Your body is telling you: this isn't rest. This is damage control.

## The Sleep-Dementia-Inflammation Connection

Here's where it all ties together:

**Poor sleep accelerates dementia.** During deep sleep, your brain's glymphatic system (the brain's waste-clearance system) flushes out amyloid-beta and tau proteins, the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Disrupt deep sleep, and these toxic proteins accumulate.

Matthew Walker (neuroscientist, author of *Why We Sleep*) calls sleep "overnight therapy" for the brain. Alcohol robs you of that therapy every single night.

**Poor sleep drives inflammation.** We covered chronic inflammation in Chapter 1. Fragmented sleep elevates IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP, the same inflammatory markers alcohol elevates through gut permeability. You're getting hit twice: once from alcohol-induced inflammation, again from alcohol-induced sleep disruption.

**Poor sleep worsens mental health.** We'll cover this more in Chapter 8, but the link is clear: poor sleep increases next-day anxiety and depression. The rebound cortisol surge at 2-4 AM primes your nervous system for next-day stress.

Alcohol fragments sleep. Fragmented sleep accelerates dementia, inflammation, and mental health decline. This isn't a side effect. This is a central mechanism of alcohol-related harm.

## The Compounding Effect After 60

Sleep architecture naturally changes with age. Older adults get less deep sleep and wake more frequently even without alcohol. This is normal aging.

But adding alcohol on top of age-related sleep changes is catastrophic. What might be manageable sleep disruption in a 30-year-old becomes severe, chronic sleep deprivation in a 70-year-old.

After 60, you need high-quality sleep more than ever. Your body repairs more slowly. Inflammation is higher. Cognitive reserve is lower. You can't afford to lose REM and deep sleep.

Alcohol guarantees you lose them.

## The Successful Aging Angle

Sleep is the foundation of everything. Energy, mood, cognition, immune function, metabolic health, inflammation regulation, all depend on restorative sleep.

You can eat perfectly, exercise daily, take every supplement, but if you're not sleeping well, none of it matters. Poor sleep undermines every other health behavior.

And after 60, sleep quality becomes even more critical. Your body's resilience is lower. The stakes are higher. Chronic sleep deprivation at this stage accelerates aging and disease faster than almost any other factor.

Alcohol is incompatible with good sleep. Full stop.

Yes, it makes you fall asleep faster. But it robs you of REM and deep sleep, fragments your night with rebound wakefulness, lowers HRV, elevates cortisol, and leaves you functionally sleep-deprived even after 7-8 hours in bed.

The "nightcap" ritual is a trap. You're trading 20 minutes of faster sleep onset for a night of low-quality, non-restorative sleep. It's a terrible trade.

The good news: stop drinking, and sleep improves within weeks. REM comes back. Deep sleep consolidates. You stop waking at 2 AM. HRV rises. You wake up actually refreshed.

People describe it as "dreaming again" or "sleeping like I did in my 20s." This isn't hyperbole. It's what happens when your brain finally gets the sleep it needs.

## Transition: From Sleep to Falls

Sleep deprivation doesn't just make you tired. It makes you unsteady.

When you're chronically sleep-deprived from alcohol, your reaction time slows, your balance worsens, and your coordination suffers. This happens even during the day, when you're sober.

Now add acute alcohol intoxication on top of chronic sleep deprivation. Your balance is already compromised. Your reflexes are already slow. And you're impaired.

This is how falls happen. This is how hip fractures happen. This is how seniors lose their independence and never fully recover.

Let's talk about balance and the catastrophic consequences of falling.
