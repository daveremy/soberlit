# Sleep: Disrupted Architecture and Fragmentation

We finish a bottle of wine by 9 PM. We fall asleep by 10. We're in bed for 7-8 hours. We should wake up refreshed.

Instead, we wake up at 2 AM. Maybe 4 AM. Heart racing. Mind spinning. Wide awake for 30 minutes, an hour, sometimes the rest of the night. When the alarm finally goes off, we feel like we got 4 hours of sleep. Because functionally, we did.

This happens most nights we drink. And if we're drinking most nights, we haven't had truly restorative sleep in years.

Alcohol is not a sleep aid. It's a sleep destroyer.

## The Myth: "Alcohol Helps Me Sleep"

This is one of the most pervasive and damaging myths about alcohol. People defend their nightly drinking with "But it helps me fall asleep!"

It does. Sort of. For about 2 hours.

Then it disrupts the entire sleep cycle.

Here's what actually happens:

**Phase 1 (Hours 0-2): Sedation, Not Sleep**

Alcohol shortens sleep latency, the time it takes to fall asleep. We pass out faster. This feels helpful.

But sedation is not sleep. We're unconscious, but our brains are not doing the restorative work of true sleep. REM sleep (Rapid Eye Movement, the dream phase) is suppressed. Deep sleep (slow-wave sleep, SWS) is disrupted.

Roehrs et al. (1999) gave subjects ~0.5 g/kg ethanol before bed (roughly 3-4 drinks for an average adult) and measured sleep architecture using polysomnography. Result: **REM sleep was reduced across the entire 8-hour sleep period.**

We fall asleep faster, but we lose the sleep that matters most.

**Phase 2 (Hours 3-8): Rebound Wakefulness, Fragmented Sleep**

As blood alcohol drops, our bodies enter withdrawal. Not severe withdrawal like tremors or seizures, but enough to disrupt sleep.

Cortisol rises. Excitatory neurotransmitters (glutamate, norepinephrine) surge. Our sympathetic nervous system activates. Heart rate and body temperature increase.

We wake up. Sometimes fully awake, staring at the ceiling. Sometimes just enough to disrupt sleep cycles, we don't remember waking, but our fitness trackers do.

This is rebound wakefulness. Our bodies are fighting the sedative effect of alcohol with an overshoot in the opposite direction. The harder we sedate (more alcohol), the harder the rebound.

And it happens **most times we drink before bed.**

---

**Phase 3 (Morning): Non-Restorative Sleep**

We got 7 hours in bed. Maybe we even got 6-7 hours of what looks like sleep on a sleep tracker.

But REM sleep was suppressed in the first half. Deep sleep was fragmented. We woke multiple times (even if we don't remember). Our heart rate variability (HRV) was low all night, a sign of poor recovery.

We wake up exhausted. Groggy. Irritable. Needing two cups of coffee to feel human.

This isn't just "getting older." This is alcohol-induced sleep disruption compounding age-related changes.

And if we're drinking most nights, we're chronically sleep-deprived. Not because we're not in bed long enough. Because the sleep we're getting is low-quality, fragmented, and non-restorative.

## What REM and Deep Sleep Actually Do (And Why Losing Them Matters)

Sleep isn't just "time your eyes are closed." Different stages of sleep serve different critical functions.

**REM Sleep (Dream Sleep):**
- Consolidates memories (especially emotional and procedural memories)
- Processes emotions, regulates mood
- Enhances learning and creativity
- Clears out amyloid-beta (the Alzheimer's protein) from the brain

Lose REM, and we lose memory consolidation. We can't learn new information as effectively. Emotional regulation weakens (hence irritability and mood swings). And amyloid-beta accumulates, accelerating dementia risk.

**Deep Sleep (Slow-Wave Sleep, SWS):**
- Physical restoration and repair
- Immune system function (produces cytokines, fights infection)
- Hormone regulation (growth hormone, cortisol balance)
- Glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity
- Clears metabolic waste from the brain

Lose deep sleep, and our bodies can't repair themselves as effectively. Immune function weakens. Insulin resistance increases (hello, weight gain and diabetes risk). Inflammation stays elevated.

Alcohol robs us of both. We get sedation and light sleep, but not the restorative phases that keep us healthy.

## Heart Rate Variability: Your Body's Report Card

Heart rate variability (HRV) measures the variation in time between heartbeats. Higher HRV = better recovery, better stress resilience, better autonomic nervous system function. Lower HRV = poor recovery, high stress, sympathetic dominance (fight-or-flight mode).

Sleep should increase HRV. Our bodies are resting, recovering, shifting into parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) mode.

Alcohol does the opposite. Even moderate doses (~0.5-1.0 g/kg, 2-4 drinks) lower HRV during sleep. Our bodies are in bed, but they're not recovering. They're in low-level fight-or-flight all night.

If we track HRV with a wearable (Oura, Whoop, Apple Watch), looking at our data after drinking nights vs. sober nights, the difference is stark. Alcohol nights show lower HRV, higher resting heart rate, and lower recovery scores.

Our bodies are telling us: this isn't rest. This is damage control.

## The Sleep-Dementia-Inflammation Connection

Here's where it all ties together:

**Poor sleep accelerates dementia.** During deep sleep, our brains' glymphatic system (the brain's waste-clearance system) flushes out amyloid-beta and tau proteins, the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Disrupt deep sleep, and these toxic proteins accumulate.

Sleep functions as overnight therapy for the brain. Alcohol disrupts that process night after night.

**Poor sleep drives inflammation.** We covered chronic inflammation in Chapter 1. Fragmented sleep elevates IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP, the same inflammatory markers alcohol elevates through gut permeability. We're getting hit twice: once from alcohol-induced inflammation, again from alcohol-induced sleep disruption.

**Poor sleep worsens mental health.** We'll cover this more in Chapter 8, but the link is clear: poor sleep increases next-day anxiety and depression. The rebound cortisol surge at 2-4 AM primes our nervous systems for next-day stress.

Alcohol fragments sleep. Fragmented sleep accelerates dementia, inflammation, and mental health decline. This isn't a side effect. This is a central mechanism of alcohol-related harm.

## The Compounding Effect After 60

Sleep architecture naturally changes with age. Older adults get less deep sleep and wake more frequently even without alcohol. This is normal aging.

But adding alcohol on top of age-related sleep changes compounds the problem significantly. What might be manageable sleep disruption in a 30-year-old becomes severe, chronic sleep deprivation in a 70-year-old.

After 60, we need high-quality sleep more than ever. Our bodies repair more slowly. Inflammation is higher. Cognitive reserve is lower. We can't afford to lose REM and deep sleep.

Alcohol substantially increases that loss.

---

## The Successful Aging Angle

Sleep is the foundation of everything. Energy, mood, cognition, immune function, metabolic health, inflammation regulation, all depend on restorative sleep.

We can eat perfectly, exercise daily, take every supplement, but if we're not sleeping well, none of it works as well. Poor sleep undermines every other health behavior.

And after 60, sleep quality becomes even more critical. Our bodies' resilience is lower. The stakes are higher. Chronic sleep deprivation at this stage accelerates aging and disease faster than almost any other factor.

Alcohol and good sleep are fundamentally incompatible.

Yes, it makes us fall asleep faster. But it robs us of REM and deep sleep, fragments our nights with rebound wakefulness, lowers HRV, elevates cortisol, and leaves us functionally sleep-deprived even after 7-8 hours in bed.

The "nightcap" ritual is counterproductive. We're trading 20 minutes of faster sleep onset for a night of low-quality, non-restorative sleep.

The good news: stop drinking, and sleep typically improves within weeks. REM comes back. Deep sleep consolidates. We stop waking at 2 AM. HRV rises. We wake up actually refreshed.

Many people report dreaming again or sleeping better than they have in years. This is what happens when our brains finally get the sleep they need.

## Transition: From Sleep to Falls

Sleep deprivation doesn't just make us tired. It makes us unsteady.

When we're chronically sleep-deprived from alcohol, our reaction time slows, our balance worsens, and our coordination suffers. This happens even during the day, when we're sober.

Now add acute alcohol intoxication on top of chronic sleep deprivation. Our balance is already compromised. Our reflexes are already slow. And we're impaired.

This is how falls happen. This is how hip fractures happen. This is how seniors lose their independence and never fully recover.

Let's talk about balance and the serious consequences of falling.
