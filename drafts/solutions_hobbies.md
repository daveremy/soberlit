# Hobbies, Games, Learning (Beat Boredom & Build Joy)

> Purpose: replace "boredom drinking" with engaging, social, or skill-building activities ([Csikszentmihalyi1990] Flow: happiness is developable through optimal engagement; boredom antidote is making/learning, not passive consumption).

## Quick-start ideas
- Book club (in-person or virtual); set a cadence.
- Games: cards/board games/puzzles; join a local group.
- Learning: short online course; language app; hobby class (art, music, photography).
- Making: gardening, cooking, crafts, DIY projects.
- Volunteering: pick a cause; commit to a small, regular slot.

## Understanding boredom after quitting
- **Boredom is actually "withdrawal from over-stimulation."** When you stop drinking, regular life can feel boring *at first* because your dopamine baseline is resetting ([DopamineRecovery]: alcohol disrupts dopamine in nucleus accumbens; most return to baseline around 90 days, full recovery 4–14 months). Alcohol artificially spikes dopamine, so your brain needs a few weeks to recalibrate to natural rewards (conversation, learning, making things).
- Frame boredom not as a lack of things to do, but as a **healing symptom that passes**. Within 2–4 weeks, hobbies that felt "meh" start feeling genuinely engaging again as your brain's reward system resets.
- This is your brain recovering its ability to experience Flow ([Csikszentmihalyi1990])—total absorption in challenging activities matched to your skill level.

## Structure to reduce friction
- Schedule 2–3 blocks/week (30–60 min) as "boredom blockers" ([Gollwitzer1999] implementation intentions: pre-commit time/place).
- Pair with a ritual NA drink to make it feel rewarding ([Duhigg2012] habit loop: anchor new routine to existing cue and reward).
- Keep a "menu" of 5 options to pick from quickly ([Fogg2020]: reduce friction by pre-deciding).

## Social angle
- Combine with movement: walk-and-talk, pickleball, tai chi group.
- Host a game night that’s alcohol-free; offer NA options.

## Tracking
- Note mood/energy before/after to see what works; keep what lifts you.
