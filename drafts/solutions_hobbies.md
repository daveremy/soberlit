# Hobbies, Games, Learning (Beat Boredom & Build Joy)

> Purpose: replace “boredom drinking” with engaging, social, or skill-building activities.

## Quick-start ideas
- Book club (in-person or virtual); set a cadence.
- Games: cards/board games/puzzles; join a local group.
- Learning: short online course; language app; hobby class (art, music, photography).
- Making: gardening, cooking, crafts, DIY projects.
- Volunteering: pick a cause; commit to a small, regular slot.

## Structure to reduce friction
- Schedule 2–3 blocks/week (30–60 min) as “boredom blockers.”
- Pair with a ritual NA drink to make it feel rewarding.
- Keep a “menu” of 5 options to pick from quickly.

## Social angle
- Combine with movement: walk-and-talk, pickleball, tai chi group.
- Host a game night that’s alcohol-free; offer NA options.

## Tracking
- Note mood/energy before/after to see what works; keep what lifts you.
