# Sleep You Can Trust (Alcohol-Free)

> Build a reliable wind-down; avoid nightcaps; support REM/SWS.

## Goals
- Consistent schedule; easier sleep onset; deeper REM/SWS without alcohol.

## Evening basics
- Set a target bedtime/wake time; dim lights 60–90 min prior.
- Cool, dark room; quiet or use white noise if needed.
- Caffeine cutoff ~8 hours before bed; heavy meals 3+ hours before; lighter snacks if needed.

## Wind-down (20–40 minutes)
- Pick 2–3: gentle stretch, breath pacing (4–6 breaths/min), light reading, journaling.
- Audio option: calming music or a short, non-stimulating podcast.
- Screen rule: if screens are needed, use low brightness; avoid stimulating content.

## Nightcap swaps
- Herbal tea, warm milk/protein, NA spritz with citrus/bitters (ensure zero alcohol), tart cherry juice diluted. For more ideas, see `drafts/solutions_hydration_substitutes.md`.
- Time fluids to limit wake-ups: taper 2–3 hours before bed; small sips only near bedtime.

## If awake in bed
- After ~20 minutes, get up; low light; repeat a short wind-down (breath/reading) until drowsy; return to bed.

## Morning anchors
- Consistent wake time; morning light exposure; move (walk/stretch); hydrate.

## Notes
- Alcohol-free nights protect REM/SWS and cut fragmentation; steadier HRV; better next-day energy. Poor sleep can heighten next-day anxiety and cravings—another reason to keep nights alcohol-free. If urges show up near bedtime, use the urge first-aid swaps in `solutions_hydration_substitutes.md` and then resume wind-down.
