# Dementia & Memory Loss

Losing cognitive function is the most feared outcome of aging. Not cancer. Not heart disease. Not even death itself.

The prospect of forgetting our grandchildren's names, losing the thread of conversations, not recognizing our spouse, becoming dependent on our family, losing *ourselves* while our bodies linger, this is what concerns us most.

And here's the clinical reality: regular alcohol consumption, even at levels most people call "moderate," measurably accelerates cognitive decline and increases dementia risk.

This isn't about heavy drinkers or alcoholics. This is about two glasses of wine most nights. This is about us.

## Our Hippocampus Is Shrinking

The hippocampus is our brain's memory center. It converts short-term memories into long-term ones, helps us navigate space, and lets us learn new information. Without a functioning hippocampus, we can't form new memories. We become trapped in an eternal present, forgetting conversations moments after they happen.

Alcohol shrinks hippocampal volume.

Topiwala et al. (2017) used brain imaging on adults with a mean age in the mid-60s, the same demographic reading this book. They measured hippocampal volume and correlated it with alcohol intake over decades.

The findings:
- **14-21 UK units per week** (roughly 10-15 US standard drinks, about 1.5-2 drinks per night): **OR 3.4** (95% CI 1.4-8.1) for right hippocampal atrophy
- **Over 30 units per week** (about 3+ drinks per night): **OR 5.8** (95% CI 1.8-18.6) for atrophy
- **Light drinking** (1-7 units/week, under 1 drink per day): **No protective effect** compared to abstinence

"Moderate" drinking, the level doctors don't worry about, the level culture celebrates, is linked to a higher likelihood of hippocampal atrophy (OR 3.4). Heavier drinking makes it worse.

And light drinking? It doesn't protect us. It just doesn't help.

This isn't theory. This is brain imaging. Our hippocampi, the structures responsible for memory formation, are physically smaller when we drink regularly.

## What Hippocampal Atrophy Feels Like

We don't feel our hippocampi shrinking. It's not like a headache or dizziness. It's subtle. Insidious. We chalk it up to "aging" or "stress" or "being tired."

But here's what it actually looks like:
- **Names don't come.** We know the person, we've known them for years, but their name is just... gone.
- **We lose the thread mid-sentence.** We're telling a story, and halfway through, we forget where we were going. "What was I saying?"
- **We walk into a room and forget why.** We're standing there, looking around, trying to remember what we came in for.
- **We repeat ourselves.** We tell the same story twice in one conversation because we don't remember we already told it.
- **Learning new things is harder.** That app our grandkid is showing us? The new route to avoid construction? It doesn't stick like it used to.

We tell ourselves it's normal. "I'm getting older." Everyone around us nods. "Yeah, senior moments. Happens to all of us."

But it's often not inevitable. It's accelerated brain aging. And alcohol is a contributing factor.

## Dementia Risk Climbs With Intake

Hippocampal atrophy is a predictor of dementia. Lose enough hippocampal volume, and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias become far more likely.

Sabia et al. (2018) followed a cohort for 23 years, tracking alcohol intake and dementia diagnosis. The findings:

- **Over 14 units per week** (about 10 US drinks, roughly 1.5 drinks per day): **~17% higher dementia risk** (95% CI 4-32%) compared to 1-14 units/week
- The relationship is dose-dependent: more alcohol = higher dementia risk

There's a complication here: abstainers in the study had elevated dementia risk too (HR 1.47 vs. 1-14 units/week). But this is the **sick-quitter effect**, people who quit drinking often do so *because* they're already sick. They have cardiometabolic illness, early cognitive symptoms, or other health problems that both increased their dementia risk and caused them to stop drinking.

Once you account for this bias, the message is clear: **keep intake low or none. There is no protective "moderate" level.**

The lowest-risk group isn't moderate drinkers. It's people who never developed a regular drinking habit in the first place.

## Neuroinflammation: The Brain Under Attack

Remember the inflammation chapter? Alcohol-induced gut permeability, endotoxin translocation, elevated IL-6 and TNF-α? That inflammation doesn't stay in our guts or bloodstream. It reaches our brains.

Inflammatory cytokines cross the blood-brain barrier. Once in the brain, they activate microglia (the brain's immune cells), which release more inflammatory molecules. This neuroinflammation damages neurons, disrupts synaptic function, and accelerates cognitive decline.

Chronic neuroinflammation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Alcohol drives neuroinflammation. We're exposing ourselves to a driver of dementia when we drink.

And after 60, when baseline neuroinflammation is already elevated (part of "inflammaging"), alcohol compounds the problem exponentially.

## Neurogenesis Suppression: Our Brains Stop Growing

Here's the good news buried in the bad: **neuroplasticity doesn't stop at 60.**

Thuret et al. (2015) showed that adults can grow new neurons throughout life, a process called neurogenesis. Our brains are capable of learning new languages, new hobbies, new skills, well into our 70s and 80s.

But neurogenesis requires the right environment. Exercise promotes it. Learning promotes it. Social engagement promotes it.

Alcohol suppresses it.

Alcohol consumption signals our brains to reduce growth, adaptation, and repair. Alcohol impedes these regenerative processes.

The hippocampus, the same structure that's shrinking from alcohol, is one of the few brain regions where neurogenesis happens in adults. Alcohol is attacking the exact place our brains are trying to repair themselves.

## The "Moderate" Drinking Myth

There's a pervasive myth that moderate drinking is "good for the brain" or at least neutral. Recent research increasingly challenges this.

Topiwala's imaging study found **no protective effect** of light drinking. Sabia's cohort found dementia risk **climbs** above low intake. Meta-analyses show the J-curve (the idea that moderate drinking is better than abstinence) disappears when you control for confounding factors.

The truth is simpler and harsher: **regular alcohol intake is detrimental to brain health.** Less is better. None is safest.

If we're drinking 1-2 glasses of wine most nights and telling ourselves it's fine because it's "moderate," the imaging studies show our hippocampi are shrinking, our dementia risk is climbing, and our brains' ability to grow new neurons is suppressed.

While socially defined as "moderate," clinically this level is associated with structural brain atrophy.

## The Sick-Quitter Effect and Abstainer Data

We'll often see studies showing abstainers have worse health outcomes than moderate drinkers. This is used to defend moderate drinking: "See? Not drinking is worse!"

This is the sick-quitter effect. Many "abstainers" are former drinkers who quit because they got sick. They have liver disease, heart disease, diabetes, or early dementia symptoms. They stopped drinking *because* they were already unwell.

When researchers lump these sick former drinkers into the "abstainer" category, it makes abstinence look risky and moderate drinking look protective.

But when researchers separate lifelong abstainers from former drinkers who quit due to illness, the protective effect of moderate drinking vanishes. The lowest-risk group is people who never established a regular drinking pattern.

Don't let biased studies fool us into thinking moderate drinking protects our brains. It doesn't.

## The Successful Aging Angle

Cognitive function is the foundation of everything else. We can have healthy hearts, strong bones, good balance, and zero cancer, but if we lose our minds, none of it matters.

Our ability to learn, remember, reason, plan, and recognize our loved ones is what makes us *us*. Lose that, and we lose everything.

Successful aging means maintaining high cognitive function, not accepting inevitable decline. Rowe & Kahn (1997) identified this as one of the three pillars of successful aging, and they emphasized it's modifiable through lifestyle choices.

Alcohol hinders cognitive preservation. It's linked to hippocampal atrophy, elevated dementia risk, neuroinflammation, and suppressed neurogenesis. These are not opinions. These are brain imaging findings and longitudinal cohort studies.

Every drink is a choice: accept accelerated cognitive decline, or protect the brains we need to thrive for the next 20-30 years.

Neuroplasticity is real. Our brains can still learn, grow, and adapt at 60, 70, 80. But they need the right fuel. Alcohol acts as a toxin, not fuel.

Abstinence often allows the brain to recover. Neuroinflammation drops. Neurogenesis resumes. Cognitive function stabilizes or improves.

Clarity gains often appear within weeks, not years. People report sharper thinking, better memory, faster recall within the first month of stopping. This isn't placebo. It's our brains finally getting what they need.

## Key takeaways (scan)

- "Moderate" intake (14-21 units/week, ~1.5-2 drinks/night) linked to hippocampal atrophy (OR 3.4)
- Heavier intake (30+ units/week) worsens atrophy (OR 5.8)
- Light drinking (under 1 drink/day) shows no protective effect vs. abstinence
- Dementia risk climbs above low intake (~17% higher at >14 units/week)
- Sick-quitter bias inflates abstainer risk; true low-risk group is lifelong light/no drinkers
- Alcohol triggers neuroinflammation (IL-6, TNF-α reach the brain)
- Alcohol suppresses neurogenesis (your brain stops growing new neurons)
- Neuroplasticity doesn't stop at 60, exercise and learning promote brain growth, alcohol blocks it
- Cognitive decline is not inevitable, it's modifiable, alcohol accelerates it
- Clarity gains often appear within weeks of stopping

## Transition: From Dementia to Sleep

Losing our memory and cognitive function is terrifying. But there's another way alcohol quietly destroys our brains, one we feel every single morning but might not connect to our evening drinking: **sleep disruption**.

Poor sleep doesn't just make us groggy. It accelerates the very dementia we just discussed. Sleep is when our brains clear out amyloid-beta (the Alzheimer's protein), consolidate memories, and repair damage. Alcohol fragments that sleep, sabotaging our brains' nightly maintenance.

Let's talk about why we're waking up exhausted even after 7-8 hours in bed.
