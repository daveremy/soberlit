# Vision & Goals (Successful Aging, Unassailable Choice)

> Anchor the “why”: living vibrant, connected, and purposeful—alcohol-free by conviction, not avoidance.

## Define your “lit” future
- Picture the next 5–20 years: health (strength, balance, sleep), relationships (partner/family/grandkids/friends), contribution (volunteering, mentoring, creating), joy (hobbies/adventures).
- Include end-of-life clarity: how you want to be present and remembered.

## Keep goals after retirement
- Set 3–5 goals that excite you (movement, learning, service, relationships).
- Break into quarterly actions; review monthly.

## Unassailable stance
- “Even if alcohol is here and no one is looking, I don’t want it. It offers zero upside for my vision.”
- Pair urges with HALT+Thirst/Stress: meet the real need (food, rest, movement, connection).

## Daily anchors
- Morning: revisit vision briefly; one affirmation; choose a small step toward a goal.
- Evening: note wins and alignment; if misaligned, adjust the plan without guilt.

## Connection
- Build and protect relationships that fit your vision; schedule regular touchpoints.
- Choose social contexts that match your goals (movement + social, learning groups, service).
