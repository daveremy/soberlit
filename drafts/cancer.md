# Audit 3: Russian Roulette (Cancer)

> **The Mechanism:** Carcinogenesis (DNA Damage)
> **The Cost:** Your Future

Men understand risk. We calculate odds. We buy insurance. We diversify portfolios. We check the tire pressure.

And yet, with alcohol, we play Russian Roulette every night and tell ourselves the gun isn't loaded.

## The Hard Data: Group 1 Carcinogen

Let's strip away the marketing. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies alcohol as a **Group 1 Carcinogen**.

That puts it in the same category as:
*   Asbestos
*   Tobacco
*   Plutonium

There is **no safe floor**. The World Health Organization is blunt: "Risk starts from the first drop."

## The Mechanism: Acetaldehyde

When you drink ethanol, your body metabolizes it into **acetaldehyde**.

Acetaldehyde is a nasty chemical. It damages your DNA and prevents your cells from repairing that damage.

Think about that. You have pre-cancerous cells in your body right now. Everyone does. Your body has a repair team (DNA repair mechanisms) designed to find them and fix them.

Alcohol:
1.  Creates more damage (promotes mutations).
2.  Handcuffs the repair team (inhibits DNA repair).

It is a perfect storm for cancer growth.

### [DIAGRAM REQUEST: The DNA Damage Loop]
*   **Visual:** A DNA Helix strand.
*   **Action:** "Acetaldehyde" molecule breaking the strand.
*   **Blocker:** "Alcohol" blocking the "Repair Enzyme" from fixing it.
*   **Result:** "Mutation."

## The Specific Risks for Men

We aren't just talking about liver cancer.
*   **Colorectal Cancer:** Alcohol is a primary driver. For men over 60, this is already a high-risk zone. Relative Risk (RR) increases by ~1.5x for moderate drinkers (Bagnardi et al., 2015).
*   **Esophageal/Throat Cancer:** The tissue that alcohol touches directly gets hit the hardest. RR increases ~5x for heavy drinkers.
*   **Liver Cancer:** Obviously.

## The "It Won't Happen to Me" Fallacy

"My grandfather drank whiskey every day and lived to 95."

Yes. And someone won the lottery yesterday. That doesn't mean buying lottery tickets is a valid retirement strategy.

You are playing the odds.
Every drink increases the odds against you.
Every alcohol-free day improves them.

## The Integrated Man Angle: Strategy

You don't walk into a casino and bet your house on 00 Green. Why are you betting your healthspan on a Pinot Noir?

Cancer is the ultimate loss of agency. It takes your future, your strength, and your dignity. You cannot eliminate risk entirely—we all die of something—but you can stop voluntarily increasing it.

This is strategic risk management. Stop betting against yourself.
