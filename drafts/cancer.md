# Cancer Risk & The “No Safe Floor” Sidebar

For people over 60, alcohol-related cancer risk is a quiet but major driver of harm. The science is clear: alcohol is a carcinogen, and risk rises with every daily drink. There’s no “safe floor”—so cutting down, or cutting it out, is one of the most powerful preventive moves you can make.

Use this section to reframe: cancer risk starts at the first drink, so any reduction is a win. You’re not “losing” a heart benefit by cutting alcohol; you’re gaining cancer protection.

## Core points
Alcohol is a Group 1 carcinogen (IARC). WHO Europe is blunt: “risk starts from the first drop… the less you drink, the safer it is.” Risk is dose-dependent, but low daily intake still raises cancer risk—there’s no safe threshold. In people 60+, cancer is a leading alcohol-attributable harm.

## Key evidence to include
Per-10 g/day increases (≈1 small drink) already move risk: breast RR ~1.05; colorectal (men) ~1.07; oral/pharynx ~1.17; esophageal SCC ~1.30 ([Bagnardi2015]; verify CIs). Heavy vs none/occasional ([Bagnardi2015]): oral/pharynx 5.13; esophageal SCC 4.95; colorectal 1.44; larynx 2.65; breast 1.61; stomach 1.21; liver 2.07; gallbladder 2.64; pancreas 1.19; lung 1.15. The guideline frame is simple: Group 1 carcinogen, no safe level ([WHO2023]).

## Sidebar: “No Safe Floor”
Even one small drink per day nudges cancer risk up; more adds more. There’s no evidence of a threshold where risk is zero. Use per +10 g/day RRs above and remind that a standard US drink ≈14 g, UK unit ≈8 g. Coach angle: “If I want to lower my cancer odds, less is better; none is safest.”

## Key takeaways (scan)
- Alcohol is a carcinogen; risk starts at the first drink.
- Per-10 g/day risks show no safe floor; small daily amounts still add risk.
- Heavy intake multiplies risk across many cancer sites.
- Best move: drink less; safest: none.
