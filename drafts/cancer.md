# Cancer Risk: No Safe Floor

For people over 60, alcohol-related cancer risk is a significant driver of harm. The science is clear: alcohol is a carcinogen, and risk rises with alcohol intake. There's no "safe floor"—so cutting down, or cutting it out, is one of the most powerful preventive moves we can make.

Cancer risk increases even at low levels, so reducing intake is beneficial. We're not "losing" a heart benefit by cutting alcohol; we're gaining cancer protection.

## Core points
Alcohol is a Group 1 carcinogen (IARC). WHO Europe is blunt: “risk starts from the first drop… the less you drink, the safer it is.” Risk is dose-dependent, but low daily intake still raises cancer risk—there’s no safe threshold. In people 60+, cancer is a leading alcohol-attributable harm.

## Key evidence to include
Per-10 g/day increases (≈1 small drink) already move risk: breast RR ~1.05; colorectal (men) ~1.07; oral/pharynx ~1.17; esophageal SCC ~1.30 ([Bagnardi2015]; verify CIs). Heavy vs none/occasional ([Bagnardi2015]): oral/pharynx 5.13; esophageal SCC 4.95; colorectal 1.44; larynx 2.65; breast 1.61; stomach 1.21; liver 2.07; gallbladder 2.64; pancreas 1.19; lung 1.15. The guideline frame is simple: Group 1 carcinogen, no safe level ([WHO2023]).

## No Safe Floor

Even one small drink per day nudges cancer risk up; more adds more. Current evidence does not show a clear threshold where risk is zero. A standard US drink contains approximately 14 g of alcohol, a UK unit approximately 8 g. If we want to lower our cancer odds, less is better; none is safest.

## The Successful Aging Angle

Cancer prevention is one of the highest-leverage health investments we can make after 60. We can't control all cancer risk, but we **can** influence this one—and the potential benefit is significant. Every alcohol-free year reduces cumulative exposure to a Group 1 carcinogen across multiple organ systems. This isn't about fear; it's about potentially extending healthspan to spend with people we love, doing things that matter. The choice is clear: alcohol offers little to no health benefit, and cutting it out significantly improves our odds ([RoweKahn1997] successful aging: low disease risk is modifiable, and prevention compounds over time).

## Key takeaways (scan)
- Alcohol is a carcinogen; risk starts at the first drink.
- Per-10 g/day risks show no safe floor; small daily amounts still add risk.
- Heavy intake multiplies risk across many cancer sites.
- Best move: drink less; safest: none.

## Transition: From Cancer to Dementia

Cancer risk is concerning because it's invisible—we can't feel it accumulating, we can't track it with a blood test, and by the time we know, it's often advanced. That's why the "no safe floor" message matters: every drink adds risk we can't see.

But there's another kind of invisible harm that operates on a faster timeline, one we might actually **feel** within weeks or months: **cognitive decline and dementia**. While cancer takes decades to manifest, alcohol's impact on our brains shows up much sooner—and for many people over 60, this is a significant concern.

Because losing our sharpness, forgetting names, losing the thread of conversations, waking up foggy and unrested every single day? That's not some abstract future threat. That's our quality of life, right now, declining progressively with continued consumption.

Let's talk about what alcohol does to our brains—and why even "moderate" drinking accelerates cognitive decline.
