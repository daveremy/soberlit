# Relationships & Presence (Alcohol-Free)

> Goal: show up, repair strain, and deepen connections without alcohol.

## Show up sober
- Plan key times with partner/family/grandkids alcohol-free to be fully present.
- Pair visits with movement or activities, not drinks.

## Repair strain
- Short apology/acknowledgment if past alcohol caused tension; focus on current change and consistency.
- Set a simple check-in rhythm with partner/family (weekly walk/coffee).

## Communication
- If offered alcohol: “I’m keeping it alcohol-free; feels better for me.”
- Listen more; slower conversations improve without alcohol.

## Grandparenting angle
- Safety and energy matter: alcohol-free increases reliability, reaction time, and memory with kids.

## Community
- Seek or start alcohol-free meetups/book clubs/game nights; volunteer as a sober way to connect.
