# Social Scripts & Sober Plans

> Supportive; practical wording; low-friction swaps for social settings.

## Why it helps
- Having words ready removes friction ([Gollwitzer1999] implementation intentions: pre-planning "if-then" responses).
- Social ease improves with practice, sleep, and confidence—not with sedation.
- You're not going to events to "not drink"—you're going to connect and socialize. Alcohol is irrelevant to that goal.

## Before an event
- Eat/hydrate; decide your NA order; set your intention.
- You aren't going to "not drink"—you're going to connect and socialize. Leave if the event is boring, not because you are worried about alcohol.
- If urges hit, recognize they're pointing to something else ([HALT] framework in `solutions_hydration_substitutes.md`): hunger, fatigue, social discomfort, or stress. Meet that need directly.

## Decline/deflect scripts (mix and match)
- “I’m good with this tonight—sleep is better when I skip alcohol.”
- “On an alcohol-free streak; sparkling with lime is perfect.”
- “Driving/early morning; keeping it alcohol-free.”
- “Taking a break—curious how I feel without it.”

## During (host/guest tactics)
- Bring NA options you genuinely enjoy (NA beer, bitters/citrus spritz, teas)—because you enjoy them, not to blend in.
- Offer to mix NA drinks; normalize alcohol-free choices (pitcher of sparkling + citrus/herbs).
- If pushed: repeat your choice calmly; pivot topic ("Anyway, how was…?").
- Hold a glass (NA) if you enjoy the ritual; you are simply choosing a drink that fits your goals.

## Social plan templates
- Coffee/walk, breakfast meetups, games/book club without alcohol.
- Pair movement + social (walk-and-talk, pickleball, casual sports, tai chi).
- Set an “anchor” NA drink for each venue you frequent; reduces decisions.

## Handling awkward moments
- If someone insists: “Thanks, I’m set.” (repeat if needed).
- If questioned: “Just testing how good I feel without it.”
