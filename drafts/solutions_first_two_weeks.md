# Launch: The First 14 Days

> **The Phase:** Extraction
> **The Goal:** Survive the Withdrawal

You have the intel. You have the plan. Now we execute.
The first 14 days are not about "thriving." They are about **extraction**.
You are pulling yourself out of a chemical dependency. It will be uncomfortable. It will be messy.
Embrace the suck.

## Safety Briefing (Read This)

If you are drinking a bottle of vodka a day, or if you shake when you stop, **do not do this alone.**
Alcohol withdrawal can kill you. If you have severe symptoms (hallucinations, seizures, uncontrollable shaking), go to the ER.
This protocol is for the man drinking 2-4 drinks a night who is tired of being slow.

## Days 1-3: The Crash

**The Symptom:** You will not sleep.
**The Reality:** Your brain is waiting for the sedative. When it doesn't come, it floods you with adrenaline.
**The Tactic:**
*   **Accept Insomnia:** Do not fight it. If you are awake at 3:00 AM, get up. Read a book. Do not lie there and panic.
*   **Hydrate:** Your body is dumping toxins. Flush the system.
*   **Eat Sugar:** Yes, sugar. Your body is used to liquid sugar (alcohol). Eat some chocolate. It kills the craving. We will clean up the diet later.

## Days 4-7: The Fog

**The Symptom:** You feel stupid.
**The Reality:** Your dopamine is offline. You have "The Flatline."
**The Tactic:**
*   **Do Not Trust Your Mood:** You will feel irritable, sad, or bored. This is chemical, not existential. Ignore it.
*   **Move:** You must move. Walk, ruck, lift. Force the endorphins.

## Days 8-14: The Awakening

**The Symptom:** You sleep through the night.
**The Reality:** The REM rebound is over. Deep sleep begins.
**The Tactic:**
*   **Protect the Sleep:** Now that you have it, guard it. No late meals. No screens.
*   **Notice the Wins:** You aren't groggy. Your face is less puffy. You have energy at 4:00 PM.

## The "One Drink" Trap

Somewhere around Day 10, you will feel good.
Your brain will say: *"See? You're fine. You can have just one."*
**Do not negotiate with terrorists.**
That voice is the addiction trying to re-install the malware.
Tell it to shut up. Keep moving.

## Summary
*   Days 1-3: Survive.
*   Days 4-7: Move.
*   Days 8-14: Observe.
