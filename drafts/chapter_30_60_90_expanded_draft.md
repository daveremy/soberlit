# Chapter 16: One Possible Path—My 30/60/90 Journey

> **Note:** I'm writing this chapter in real-time as I live it. This isn't a prescription—it's a case study of n=1: me. Your path will look different. Your triggers, timeline, and strategies will be yours. Use this as one data point, not a template.

## Why I'm Documenting This

I'm in my 60s, retired tech CEO/CTO (though I still identify as a software developer at heart—that's who I am, not the titles). I've been drinking regularly throughout my adult life. Not consistently heavy, but regular. Periods of excess (startup years, stressful exits, celebrations), periods where I'd stop for a few months (New Year's resolutions, health kicks), but never longer than that. The pattern always came back.

In retirement, it settled into a daily rhythm: wine with dinner—two glasses most nights, sometimes three. It crept up slowly. In my working years, it was weekends and special occasions. In retirement, "special occasion" became "Tuesday." The bottle that used to last a week now lasts three days.

My baseline: Healthy weight, active (walk most days, tinker with projects), no major health issues except creeping blood pressure (140/85 on last check, doc wants me to watch it). Sleep has been mediocre—wake up 2-3 times a night, groggy in the morning. Memory feels a bit fuzzier than it should. Balance isn't what it was. Classic aging, I told myself.

**Why I'm doing this:** I saw the research. I read the headlines. I'm a data person—I trust rigorous studies, not anecdotes. When I dug into the evidence (the actual papers, not the news summaries), the picture was clear: alcohol is costing me more than I thought. I counted my weekly drinks and didn't like the number (14-18 units/week, sometimes more). I want to see what I'm capable of at this age without the dimmer switch of alcohol turned down. I want to be present, sharp, energized. I want to see if the "successful aging" vision I wrote about in Chapter 9 is actually achievable, or if I'm just dimming my way toward decline.

**Why I'm documenting this:** I'm a systems thinker. I want to understand the mechanics: what triggers me, what works, what doesn't. I'm also building this book as the knowledge base for an AI-driven coaching application, so documenting my lived experience creates real training data. But beyond that: to show what's possible AND to capture the reality. The wins and the struggles. The days I feel invincible and the days I question why I'm doing this. If you're reading this, you're probably wondering: "Can I actually do this? What will it feel like?" This chapter is my answer: Here's what it felt like for me. Your mileage will vary.

## My Starting Framework

Before Day 0, I set up my system (based on the frameworks in earlier chapters):

**Kitchen stocked:**
- NA options: Topo Chico, ginger beer, tonic, bitters, limes, fresh mint
- "Treat" drawer: dark chocolate, high-quality ice cream
- My signature 6 PM spritz recipe ready (Chapter 10)

**Evening ritual designed:**
- 6 PM: make NA spritz with intention (nice glass, garnish, sit down)
- After dinner: herbal tea, dim lights, book or podcast
- 9:30 PM: wind-down routine (breath pacing, light stretch)

**Tracking tools:**
- Simple journal: daily HALT check, sleep quality (1-10), energy (1-10), mood (1-10)
- Monthly check-in: review patterns, adjust plan

**Social scripts ready:**
- "I'm on an alcohol-free experiment—curious how I feel without it."
- "Sleep is better when I skip alcohol."

**Support:**
- Partner knows what I'm doing, is supportive
- Not hiding it, not making it a big deal

**Commitment to transparency:**
- If I choose to drink, I'll document it with an after-action review (no guilt, just data)

## Phase 0: Days 0-7 (Audit & Define Territory)

### Day 0 (Sunday)
- **What I did:** Finished the last bottle in the house. Didn't pour it down the drain (that would feel like fear/avoidance). Just... didn't restock. Told myself: "The bottle in the fridge is now as irrelevant as bleach. I know it's toxic, so I don't want it."
- **How I felt:** Determined. A little nervous. "Can I actually do this?"
- **Evening:** Made my first NA spritz. Used the wine glass. Sat on the porch. It... wasn't bad. Different. The ritual felt familiar, the taste was interesting (bitters + lime), but my brain knew it wasn't alcohol. Felt a bit like I was "playing pretend."

### Day 1-2 (Monday-Tuesday)
- **Sleep:** Night 1: woke 3 times (normal). Night 2: woke 2 times. Groggy in the morning both days.
- **Energy:** About the same as usual. No magic improvement yet.
- **Mood:** Novelty is still high. I'm doing the thing!
- **6 PM ritual:** Day 2 was harder. The autopilot kicked in: "Dinner is in an hour. Time to pour." Caught myself reaching for where the wine used to be. Paused. HALT check: not hungry, not angry... just habituated. Made the spritz. Felt a little silly, but got through it.

### Day 3-4 (Wednesday-Thursday)
- **The boredom hits:** Day 3, around 7 PM, after dinner. I'd normally be on my second glass, feeling relaxed, maybe watching something on TV. Instead, I'm just... sitting there. Fidgety. "What do I DO now?" Tried reading—couldn't focus. Tried a walk—too cold. Ended up eating ice cream (hello, substitute reward).
- **Irritability:** Day 4, I snapped at my partner over something minor. Apologized immediately. Realized: I'm not getting my evening "sedation," so I'm feeling things more sharply. Not sure if this is good or bad yet.
- **HALT check (Day 4 evening):** Hungry? No. Angry? A little (general irritability). Lonely? No. Tired? Yes—tired of thinking about this.
- **Coping:** Made a more elaborate NA drink (ginger zinger from Chapter 10), called a friend for 20 minutes. Crav ing passed.

### Day 5-7 (Friday-Sunday)
- **First social test (Day 5):** Dinner with friends at their house. They offered wine. Used my script: "I'm on an alcohol-free experiment, curious how I feel. Got any sparkling water?" They were cool about it. Drank Topo Chico. Felt a little left out during the "let's open another bottle" moment, but not as awkward as I feared.
- **Weekend challenge:** Saturdays used to mean day drinking (brunch mimosa, afternoon wine on the patio). Day 6, I felt the pull hard around 3 PM. Not physical craving—just... "This is what Saturday feels like." HALT check: Bored. Solution: drove to the hardware store, started a small project (new shelves in the garage). Kept my hands and brain busy. Worked.
- **Sleep (end of week 1):** Still waking 2x/night, but falling back asleep faster. Dreams are starting to feel more vivid.
- **Mood:** Questioning why I'm doing this. The "novelty high" wore off. This is just daily life now. And it's kind of boring.

**Week 1 takeaway:** Harder than I expected, not in a physical withdrawal way, but in a "what do I do with my evenings?" way. The ritual works (making an NA drink), but my brain knows it's a substitute. Boredom is real. Irritability is real. No dramatic improvements yet. But I'm through the first week. That's something.

## Phase 1: Days 8-30 (Replace & Stabilize)

### Week 2 (Days 8-14)
- **Sleep breakthrough (Day 10-11):** Woke only ONCE on night 10. Woke ZERO times on night 11. This hasn't happened in... years? Morning energy noticeably better. Not "leaping out of bed," but less groggy.
- **The slog:** Days 12-14 felt like a slog. No more novelty. No dramatic changes. Just doing the thing. Made my NA drink every night. Went through the motions. Felt like I was "white-knuckling" it, even though I wasn't craving alcohol specifically—just craving... something.
- **HALT pattern emerging:** Reviewed my journal. Triggers cluster around 3 times: (1) 6 PM evening transition, (2) Saturday afternoon, (3) after any social stress (even minor). All three are "boredom + transition" moments, not true hunger/anger/loneliness.

### Week 3 (Days 15-21)
- **Energy spike (Day 18-20):** This was noticeable. Afternoons usually had a slump around 2-3 PM. By day 18, the slump... wasn't there. I had steady energy all day. Not jittery, just... present. Clear-headed.
- **Hobby re-engagement (Day 19):** Started playing guitar again (hadn't touched it in months). Practiced for 30 minutes. It felt... fun? Not "forcing myself to fill time" but genuinely enjoyable. Is this the dopamine reset people talk about?
- **Social comfort improving:** Dinner party on Day 20. Used my scripts. Didn't feel awkward. Held my NA ginger zinger, got compliments on it ("That looks good—what is it?"). Left the party feeling energized, not foggy. Drove home clear-headed.
- **Sleep:** Consistently waking 0-1 times per night now. Mornings are easier. Remembering my dreams.

### Week 4 (Days 22-28)
- **The wedding choice (Day 23):** Went to a wedding. Open bar. Everyone drinking. I'd been doing great for 22 days. Around 8 PM, I chose to have a glass of champagne. Here's the after-action review:
  - **Before the choice:** HALT check—not hungry, not angry, not lonely. Stressed? Yes. Social overwhelm (loud, lots of people, exhausting). Tired? Yes (it was 8 PM, I'd been "on" since 2 PM).
  - **What I hoped the drink would do:** Help me relax, fit in, enjoy the moment.
  - **What actually happened:** Drank one glass. Felt the familiar warmth. Felt "normal" for about 20 minutes. Then: tired. Really tired. Left the wedding early (9:30 PM). Sleep that night: woke 3 times, groggy the next morning. Mood the next day: irritable, slightly down.
  - **What I learned:** The drink didn't make me enjoy the moment—it made me tired and checked out. What I actually needed: to leave earlier (I was overstimulated), or step outside for 10 minutes to reset. The alcohol was a shortcut that didn't work.
  - **Next step:** Updated my plan: pre-event HALT check. If stress/overwhelm, build in an "escape valve" (step outside, take a break) instead of drinking to cope.
- **Week 4 momentum:** Back to alcohol-free on Day 24. No guilt spiral. Just: "Okay, I chose that, it didn't serve me, moving on." Days 25-28 felt solid. NA drink ritual feels natural now. Boredom is less intense—hobbies are filling the space.

**Phase 1 takeaway:** The dopamine reset is real. Around Day 18-25, things that felt "meh" at Day 10 (hobbies, conversations, simple pleasures) started feeling genuinely engaging. Sleep is dramatically better. Energy is steady. The wedding taught me: I don't actually miss alcohol—I miss what I think it does (which is an illusion). After-action reviews > guilt spirals.

## Phase 2: Days 31-60 (Build Capacity)

### Month 2 Overview
- **No longer counting days obsessively:** I stopped checking my tracker every day around Day 35. It's just how I live now.
- **"Unfuckwithable" feeling emerging:** Went to the grocery store (Day 40). Walked right past the wine aisle. Felt... nothing. No pull. No "I'm being good by avoiding it." Just... irrelevant. Like walking past the cleaning supplies. This is the mindset shift I was hoping for.
- **Physical changes:**
  - Sleep: 7-8 hours solid most nights, waking 0-1 times. Dreams are vivid, memorable.
  - Energy: Consistent throughout the day. No afternoon slump.
  - Weight: Down 4 lbs without trying (turns out wine has calories).
  - Blood pressure: Checked it at the pharmacy (Day 50): 128/78. Down from 140/85. Didn't change anything else.
  - Balance: Feels steadier (hard to quantify, but noticeable when I do my daily balance exercises from Chapter 11).

### Relationships Deepening
- **Conversations with my partner (Days 35-50):** We've been having longer, deeper conversations after dinner. I'm present in a way I wasn't before. She noticed: "You're actually listening, not just waiting to talk." It's true. I'm not half-thinking about my second glass or waiting for the conversation to end so I can zone out.
- **Grandkids visit (Day 45):** They stayed for the weekend. I played with them for hours (not just an hour before I was "done"). Got on the floor with them (balance!), built Legos, read stories. Felt present the whole time. Didn't feel "on" or "performative"—just... there. They won't remember the specifics, but they'll remember how I showed up.

### Challenges
- **Travel test (Days 52-58): Cruise with friends.**
  - This was the big one. 7-day cruise. All-inclusive alcohol. Social pressure. "It's vacation!"
  - Strategy: Brought my own NA bitters and limes (TSA-approved). Made my own drinks at the bar (asked for soda water + bitters + lime). Brought herbal tea bags for evenings.
  - Reality: Day 1 (embarkation): Hardest. Everyone's drinking champagne at the sail-away party. I had my NA spritz. Felt a bit "other." But stuck with it.
  - Days 2-5: Easier. Got into a rhythm. Morning coffee on the deck. Afternoon NA drinks. Evening dinners (I was the only sober one at the table, but I wasn't explaining or defending—just doing my thing). Slept amazingly well while everyone else complained about the ship rocking and interrupted sleep.
  - Day 6: One person at dinner (tipsy) pushed: "Come on, it's vacation!" I used my script: "I'm good with this—sleep is way better when I skip alcohol." They dropped it.
  - Result: Came home feeling energized, not wiped out. Everyone else had hangovers on disembark day. I was up early, packed, ready to go.

**Phase 2 takeaway:** The "unfuckwithable" mindset is real. Alcohol in the environment (grocery store, cruise ship bar, friends' houses) doesn't trigger me anymore. I'm not "resisting" it—I genuinely don't want it. Relationships are deeper (presence matters). Physical gains are stacking (sleep, energy, BP, balance). The travel test proved: I can do this anywhere, with anyone, in any context. It's not about willpower—it's about conviction.

## Phase 3: Days 61-90 (Deepen & Integrate)

### Month 3 Overview
- **This is just how I live now:** Around Day 65, I stopped thinking of this as a "project" or "experiment." It's just... life. Alcohol-free is my default. The question isn't "Will I drink?" It's "What am I having instead?" (Usually my 6 PM spritz or ginger tea.)
- **New hobby integrated:** Picked up woodworking (Day 70). Built a small table for the porch. The focus required—measuring, cutting, sanding—was meditative. Flow state. This is the "higher frequency" thing I wrote about in the intro. I'm operating at a level of engagement I forgot was possible.
- **Legacy angle hitting home:** My daughter mentioned (Day 75): "You seem happier, Dad. More... here." That landed. This is what I want them to remember. Not "Dad had a glass of wine at every dinner." But "Dad was present. Sharp. Engaged."

### Sleep/Energy/Clarity Gains (Undeniable)
- **Sleep (Days 61-90):** Consistently 7.5-8 hours, waking 0-1 times. REM sleep (based on Garmin watch) is higher than it's been in years. Mornings: wake up before the alarm, clear-headed, energized.
- **Energy:** All day, steady. I can work on projects for hours without needing a break or feeling sluggish.
- **Cognitive clarity:** Reading more (finishing 2-3 books/month vs. starting and abandoning them). Remembering details in conversations. Learning new things (Spanish on Duolingo, woodworking techniques). This is the "neuroplasticity doesn't stop at 60" thing from Chapter 5. My brain is working *better* at 65 than it was at 63.

### Social Observations
- **Drinking culture becomes visible (Day 80):** Went to a retirement community event. Watched people at the bar. Multiple people on their 3rd-4th drink by 7 PM. Slurring. Repetitive conversations. One guy stumbled getting up from his chair. I used to BE that guy. Now I see it from the outside. It's... sad. Not judging them, but seeing clearly: that's not freedom. That's dimming.
- **I'm not evangelizing:** I don't talk about this unless asked. But when people ask ("Why aren't you drinking?"), I'm honest: "I wanted to see what my best life looks like without it. Turns out, it's better." Some people are curious. Some are defensive. I'm not here to convince anyone—just to live my example.

### Looking Forward (Day 90 reflection)
- **What year 1 looks like:** I'm not "going back." This isn't a temporary experiment. I'm alcohol-free, indefinitely. Not because I "have to," but because I want to. The gains are too clear: sleep, energy, presence, cognitive sharpness, deeper relationships, physical improvements (BP, balance, weight).
- **Maintenance plan:** No rigid rules. I'll keep my evening ritual (NA drinks I genuinely enjoy). I'll keep my HALT framework (check in before urges, address the real need). I'll keep journaling (monthly check-ins, not daily). I'll stay connected to my "why" (the Sober Lit vision from Chapter 9).
- **What about the future?** Will I ever drink again? I don't know. I'm not saying "never." I'm saying "not now, not for the foreseeable future, because I don't want to." If a situation arises where I choose to have a drink, I'll do an after-action review (like Day 23), learn from it, and recommit. No guilt, no shame. Just data.

## Closing: This Was My Path

**Days 0-30:** Hardest. Boredom, irritability, questioning why I'm doing this. But sleep started improving by Day 10, energy spike around Day 18, dopamine reset by Day 25.

**Days 31-60:** Solidifying. "Unfuckwithable" mindset emerging. Physical gains stacking. Relationships deepening. Survived the travel test (cruise).

**Days 61-90:** Integration. This is just how I live. New hobbies, deeper presence, legacy awareness. Sleep/energy/clarity are undeniable.

**Your path will have different milestones, different struggles, different wins.** Your Day 23 might not be a wedding—it might be a stressful week at home, or a holiday, or a random Tuesday. Your dopamine reset might happen at Day 15 or Day 40. Your "unfuckwithable" moment might come sooner or later.

The frameworks (HALT, trigger swaps, social scripts, evening rituals) are tools you can adapt. The evidence (Part II of this book) is your "why." Your daily choices are the "how."

If you're using an AI coach or app with this book, treat it like a thinking partner: journal your experience, let it pattern-match to the frameworks here, build YOUR individualized path. Don't try to replicate mine—learn from it, take what works, discard what doesn't, and make it yours.

**Three things I learned over 90 days:**

1. **Boredom is real, but it's a symptom, not a problem.** It's your dopamine system recalibrating. It passes. By Day 25, hobbies felt fun again.

2. **Sleep is the early win.** It improves within 10-14 days for most people. That's your proof of concept. "This is working."

3. **The "unfuckwithable" mindset is a destination, not a starting point.** On Day 0, I was nervous, unsure. By Day 60, alcohol was irrelevant. You get there by doing the days, not by willing yourself to feel differently.

**Where I am now (Day 90 +):** I'm writing this book as I live it. The GitHub repo has my real-time updates. If you want to follow along, it's there. Your path will be different, but maybe my example helps you see what's possible.

Let's build your Sober Lit life. Together.
