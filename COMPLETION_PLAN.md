## Writing Sequence & Dependencies

### Phase 1: Part III (Philosophy/Identity) - PRIORITY
**Why first:** Part IV tactics need to reference Part III philosophy. Part V execution integrates both.

**Suggested order:**
1. Chapter 1: Mortality Paradox (foundation for everything)
2. Chapter 2: We Are All Athletes (sets up Movement chapter in Part IV)
3. Chapter 3: Chosen Adversity (complements Athletes chapter)
4. Chapter 4: Emotional Operating System (frameworks for Part V execution)
5. Chapter 5: Connection & Community (can be written anytime)
6. Chapter 6: Modern Elder (can be written anytime, references back to cognitive reserve)

**Estimated time:** 6 chapters × ~4,000 words = ~24,000 words

---

### Phase 2: Part IV (Tactical Implementation)
**Dependencies:** Needs Part III complete to properly reference philosophy

**Suggested order:**
1. Movement Protocols (directly follows Part III Ch 2)
2. Sleep Rituals (high-impact, references Part II Sleep chapter)
3. Nutrition & Supplements (foundational)
4. Hydration & Substitutes (practical, quick)
5. Hobbies & Learning (references Part III Ch 6)
6. Spirituality & Mindfulness (flexible)
7. Relationships & Connection (finish existing draft, references Part III Ch 5)

**Estimated time:** ~6 new chapters × ~3,000 words = ~18,000 words

---

### Phase 3: Part V (Execution) - FINAL
**Dependencies:** Needs Part III and Part IV complete to integrate properly

**Order:**
1. The 30/60/90 Day Plan (integrates all of Part IV)
2. The Long Game (maintenance, future vision)

**Estimated time:** ~8,000 words

---

## Total Remaining Content

- **Part III:** ~24,000 words (6 chapters)
- **Part IV:** ~18,000 words (6 chapters)
- **Part V:** ~8,000 words (2 chapters)

**Total remaining:** ~50,000 words (14 chapters)

**Current completed:** ~60,000-70,000 words (Part I, II, partial V)

**Projected book total:** ~110,000-120,000 words

## Open Questions / Decisions Needed

1. **Author's personal journey in Part V:**
   - How much personal detail to include in 30/60/90 plan?
   - Live updates as author progresses, or retrospective?

2. **Part IV chapter length:**
   - Keep tactical chapters short (~2,500 words) or more comprehensive (~4,000 words)?
   - Balance between reference manual vs. readable narrative?

3. **Appendices:**
   - Need formal appendix for references?
   - Quick-reference sheets for HALT, social scripts, etc.?
   - Resource list (books, AI tools, bio-trackers)?

4. **Data gaps mentioned in outline:**
   - Falls: hip-fracture-specific stat (optional)
   - Meds: additional bleed/hypo figure (optional)
   - Mental health: anxiety-specific RR (optional)
   - Sleep: REM/SWS % reduction by dose (optional)
   - Are these needed or is current evidence sufficient?

---

## Success Criteria

**A complete first draft means:**
- [ ] All 14 remaining chapters written (Part III, IV, V)
- [ ] All chapters reviewed by Gemini at least once
- [ ] Voice, tone, and style consistent throughout
- [ ] All cross-references accurate
- [ ] No major gaps in evidence or philosophy
- [ ] Ready for beta reader review (not final polish)

**NOT required for first draft:**
- Professional editing
- Final citation formatting
- Cover design
- Publishing decisions
- Marketing materials

---

## Notes

- Writing style: Morgan Housel-inspired (conceptual, readable, research-backed)
- Target audience: 60+, retired/semi-retired, health-conscious, evidence-oriented
- Voice: "We" throughout (solidarity, not instructor/student)
- Tone Part III: Philosophical but grounded, inspiring but not fluff
- Tone Part IV: Prescriptive, actionable, reference-able
- This is health optimization, NOT recovery literature

---

**Next immediate action:** Draft Chapter 1: The Mortality Paradox (Part III)
