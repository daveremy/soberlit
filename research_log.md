### Myth Box: The J-Curve (Heart Health)
- Claim: “a little alcohol protects the heart.”
- Bias sources: sick-quitters in “abstainers,” under-reporting, reverse causality, survivorship.
- Consensus trend: net harm; safest level ~0 for alcohol-related cancers and AFib; guidelines moving down.
- Pull-quote slot: _______________________________________________

### How to Read This Evidence (supportive)
- Prefer meta-analyses and large cohorts; look for dose-response.
- Note population age bands—flag when 60+ is included or underrepresented.
- Watch for confounders (smoking, SES, diet); sick-quitter bias; self-report limits.
- Capture absolute risk changes (not just relative) for real-world clarity.
- Log limitations openly; build trust rather than scaremongering.

### Confirmed entries (with direct quotes/numbers)

- **WHO Europe/WHO statement Jan 2023 — “No level of alcohol consumption is safe for our health”**  
  - Type: guideline/editorial.  
  - Population/age: general; highlights cancer burden; relevant to 60+.  
  - Key quote: “We cannot talk about a so-called safe level of alcohol use. It doesn’t matter how much you drink – the risk to the drinker’s health starts from the first drop of any alcoholic beverage. The only thing that we can say for sure is that the more you drink, the more harmful it is – or, in other words, the less you drink, the safer it is,” (WHO Europe news, 4 Jan 2023).  
  - How to use: anchor “no safe level” and cancer framing.

- **Wood et al., Lancet 2018 — 599,912 drinkers, risk thresholds**  
  - Type: pooled cohort.  
  - Population/age: 40–75; includes 65+.  
  - Effect sizes (per 100 g/week higher intake): stroke HR 1.14 (1.10–1.17); heart failure 1.09 (1.03–1.15); fatal hypertensive disease 1.24 (1.15–1.33); fatal aortic aneurysm 1.15 (1.03–1.28); minimum mortality risk around or below 100 g/week.  
  - Life expectancy: vs >0–≤100 g/week, those >100–≤200 g/week lived ≈6 months fewer; >200–≤350 ≈1–2 years fewer; >350 ≈4–5 years fewer at age 40 baseline.  
  - How to use: harm rises above ~1 drink/day; “J-curve” not protective for stroke/HTN/AF drivers.

- **Topiwala et al., BMJ 2017 — Whitehall II MRI**  
  - Type: cohort + imaging.  
  - Population/age: mean age mid-60s at imaging.  
  - Effect: >30 UK units/week OR for hippocampal atrophy 5.8 (95% CI 1.8–18.6) vs abstainers; 14–21 units/week OR 3.4 (1.4–8.1) right hippocampal atrophy; “no protective effect of light drinking (1–<7 units/week) over abstinence.”  
  - How to use: moderate intake linked to brain atrophy; counters “moderate is safe for brain.”

- **Voskoboinik et al., NEJM 2020 — AF abstinence RCT**  
  - Type: RCT.  
  - Population/age: mean 62±9; paroxysmal/persistent AF; baseline ~17 drinks/week.  
  - Effect: AF recurrence 53% abstinence vs 73% control over 6 months; HR 0.55 (95% CI 0.36–0.84; P=0.005); AF burden median 0.5% vs 1.2%.  
  - How to use: concrete cardiovascular rhythm benefit from stopping in regular drinkers.

- **Roerecke et al., Lancet Public Health 2017 — BP reduction meta-analysis**  
  - Type: meta-analysis of 36 trials.  
  - Population/age: adults; mixed but relevant to 60+.  
  - Effect: “reduction in systolic blood pressure (mean difference −5.50 mm Hg, 95% CI −6.70 to −4.30) and diastolic blood pressure (−3.97, −4.70 to −3.25) was strongest in participants who drank six or more drinks per day if they reduced their intake by about 50%.” No significant BP change when ≤2 drinks/day.  
  - How to use: fast, dose-dependent BP win from cutting back, especially for heavier older drinkers.

- **Bagnardi et al., Br J Cancer 2015 — site-specific cancer meta-analysis**  
  - Type: dose-response meta-analysis (572 studies; 486,538 cases).  
  - Population/age: adults.  
  - Effect (heavy vs nondrinkers/occasional): oral/pharyngeal RR 5.13; esophageal squamous RR 4.95; colorectal RR 1.44; laryngeal RR 2.65; breast RR 1.61; stomach RR 1.21; liver RR 2.07; gallbladder RR 2.64; pancreas RR 1.19; lung RR 1.15. Clear dose-risk relationship; light drinking not protective.  
  - How to use: illustrates broad, dose-related cancer risks; support “no safe floor” message.

- **Bagnardi et al., Br J Cancer 2015 — per-10 g/day dose response (light–moderate)**  
  - Type: dose-response meta-analysis.  
  - Effect (per +10 g/day): breast RR ~1.05; colorectal (men) ~1.07; oral/pharynx ~1.17; esophageal squamous ~1.30 (check CIs in full text).  
  - How to use: show that even one small drink/day raises cancer risk; no safe floor.

- **Sabia et al., BMJ 2018 (Whitehall II cohort, 23-year follow-up)**  
  - Type: cohort.  
  - Population/age: midlife adults followed into older age.  
  - Effect: abstinence at midlife HR 1.47 (1.15–1.89) vs 1–14 units/week; consumption >14 units/week associated with 17% higher dementia risk (CI 4%–32%).  
  - How to use: dementia risk rises above low intake; “moderate protects” not reliable after bias adjustment; abstinence risk driven partly by cardiometabolic illness (sick-quitter issue).

- **Sleep architecture (Roehrs & Roth review; experimental sleep lab data)**  
  - Type: review/experimental.  
  - Population: adults.  
  - Effect: evening alcohol (~0.5–1.0 g/kg) shortens sleep latency but suppresses REM in the first half of the night (roughly 10–40% reduction reported), increases arousals and wake in the second half, and reduces HRV; net sleep is more fragmented with less restorative REM/SWS.  
  - How to use: counter “helps me sleep” myth with mechanism (early sedation, later rebound wake/REM suppression).

- **Falls and balance (acute alcohol and injury/fall risk)**  
  - Type: meta-analysis (Taylor et al., Drug Alcohol Depend. 2010).  
  - Population: adults.  
  - Effect: non-motor vehicle injury OR increases 1.30 (95% CI 1.26–1.34) per +10 g alcohol on an occasion, reaching OR ~24.2 at 140 g; motor vehicle OR increases 1.24 (1.18–1.31) per +10 g, reaching ~52 at 120 g. Case-crossover risks for non-MVA higher than case-control; per-drink increase highest for intentional injury (OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.22–1.55).  
  - How to use: acute, dose-dependent injury risk; for older adults, translates to higher fall/hip fracture risk given baseline vulnerability.

- **Medication interactions (NIAAA Clinician’s Guide; AGS Beers Criteria)**  
  - Type: guideline.  
  - Effect: increased bleed risk with anticoagulants/antiplatelets (e.g., warfarin, DOACs, aspirin/NSAIDs); additive hypotension with antihypertensives; hypoglycemia risk with insulin/sulfonylureas; respiratory depression/sedation with benzos, opioids, sleep aids (Z-drugs); reduced med adherence/efficacy.  
  - Key warnings to quote:  
    - “Alcohol can increase the effect of warfarin and raise the risk of bleeding.” (NIAAA Clinician’s Guide)  
    - “Combining opioids, benzodiazepines, or sedative-hypnotics with alcohol may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death.” (FDA boxed warnings; echoed in Beers)  
    - “Alcohol can cause hypoglycemia, especially when combined with insulin or sulfonylureas.” (NIAAA)  
  - How to use: safety box for polypharmacy in 60+; no safe combo for sedatives/opioids with alcohol.

- **Mental health (Boden & Fergusson 2011 meta/review)**  
  - Type: meta/review.  
  - Effect: pooled adjusted ORs for AUD → MD ~2.0 (2.00–2.09); bidirectional, but strongest causal path AUD → depression; mechanisms include neurophysiological/metabolic changes.  
  - How to use: counter “relaxation” myth; highlight that heavier involvement doubles later depression risk.

 - **Anxiety risk (meta-analysis, Lees et al., Lancet Psychiatry 2020)**  
  - Type: meta-analysis of common mental disorders and alcohol use disorders.  
  - Effect: OR 1.94 (95% CI 1.35–2.78) for association between anxiety/phobic disorder and alcohol use disorder.  
  - Note: Direction is comorbidity; use cautiously for causality. Supports bidirectional link and rebound anxiety narrative.  
  - How to use: reinforce rebound/anxiety cycle; link to sleep disruption.
- **Falls and balance (acute alcohol and injury/fall risk)**  
  - Type: meta-analyses/case-crossover (e.g., Taylor et al., Addiction 2010; injury risk studies).  
  - Population: adults; risk amplified in older adults due to baseline balance/fall risk.  
  - Effect: acute alcohol roughly doubles odds of fall/injury at moderate intoxication; higher doses raise risk further (dose-response).  
  - How to use: link acute drinking to fractures/hip risk in 60+; emphasize compounding with slower reaction time and osteopenia.

- **Fracture risk (Adv Nutr 2023 dose-response meta-analysis)**  
  - Type: dose-response meta-analysis (44 studies; 6,069,770 participants; 205,284 fractures).  
  - Effect: highest vs lowest alcohol—total fracture RR 1.26 (1.17–1.37); osteoporotic RR 1.24 (1.13–1.35); hip fracture RR 1.20 (1.03–1.40). Linear increase: +6% total fracture risk per +14 g/day (RR 1.06; 95% CI 1.02–1.10).  
  - How to use: quantify fracture risk (including hip) with dose; shows no safety in higher intake.

- **Medication interactions (NIAAA Clinician’s Guide; AGS Beers Criteria)**  
  - Type: guideline.  
  - Effect: increased bleed risk with anticoagulants/antiplatelets; additive hypotension with antihypertensives; hypoglycemia risk with insulin/sulfonylureas; respiratory depression/sedation with benzos, opioids, sleep aids; reduced med adherence/efficacy.  
  - How to use: safety box for polypharmacy in 60+; no safe combo for sedatives/opioids with alcohol.

- **Mental health (Boden & Fergusson 2011 meta/review; longitudinal studies)**  
  - Type: meta/review.  
  - Effect: higher alcohol use predicts later depression/anxiety; pooled estimates often ~1.2–1.6× risk for later depression, heavier use higher; rebound anxiety after drinking contributes to the cycle.  
  - How to use: counter “relaxation” myth; note bidirectional link and rebound anxiety.

   - Outcome: all-cause risk; DALYs.  
   - Dose/exposure: grams/day.  
   - Effect: theoretical minimum risk level ≈0 drinks/day; all-cause risk climbs from ~10 g/day upward.  
   - Note: Leading causes of alcohol-attributable burden in older adults include cancer and cardiovascular disease.  
   - Limitations: observational inputs; self-report; modelling assumptions.  
   - How to use: anchor “no safe level” and emphasize cancer/CV dominance after 50.

   - Outcome: all-cause mortality, CV subtypes, life expectancy.  
   - Dose: weekly grams of alcohol.  
   - Effect: lowest risk ≤100 g/week (~7 US drinks). Above this, stroke/heart failure/fatal HTN rise. ~350 g/week linked to ≈4–5 years shorter life expectancy at age 40 baseline. HRs (per 100 g/week): stroke ~1.14, heart failure ~1.09, fatal HTN ~1.24, aortic aneurysm ~1.15 (verify).  
   - Limitations: residual confounding; self-report; sick-quitter handling varies by cohort.  
   - How to use: set “no upside above 1 drink/day; harm rises steadily; bigger hits for HTN/stroke.”

3) **WHO/IARC Monograph 100E (2012) + WHO 2023 “No safe level”**  
   - Type: carcinogen classification/guideline/editorial.  
   - Effect: alcohol = Group 1 carcinogen; no safe threshold for cancer risk. 2023 WHO: “no safe level that does not affect health.”  
   - How to use: underpin cancer claims; cite sites (breast, colorectal, esophageal, oral, liver).

4) **Bagnardi V et al., meta-analyses of cancer risk (2015)**  
   - Type: meta-analyses.  
   - Effect (per 10 g/day): breast cancer RR ~1.05; colorectal (men) RR ~1.07; esophageal squamous RR ~1.30; oral/pharyngeal RR ~1.17 (verify CIs).  
   - How to use: dose-response; no safe floor; emphasize small daily amounts increase cancer risk.
