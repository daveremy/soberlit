## Chapter 2 — Trail Disintegration and a Small Crew

By the end of the third day, I had a rhythm of sorts.

Wake up in the gray just before dawn.  
Wrestle the sleeping bag into its sack, the pad into its sleeve, the small civilization of the tent back into the pack.  
Force myself to eat when my stomach was not yet convinced.  
Filter water if there was any to filter.  
Walk.

The distances were not heroic. Fifteen, eighteen miles, depending on water and terrain. Enough that my body noticed. Enough that the parts I had been neglecting at home—feet, ankles, hips, lower back—had something to say about my past priorities.

The disintegration did not show up as a dramatic failure. It showed up as a hundred small frayed edges.

The left shoulder strap that always seemed to ride higher than the right.  
The way my pack never sat quite right no matter how I adjusted it.  
The fact that I seemed to spend an inordinate amount of time looking for small items I had just put down.  
The way my mind slid toward screens that weren’t there every time I felt a little bored or uncomfortable.

The Arizona Trail has a way of turning metaphors into reality.

The same drift I had been tolerating in my life—tolerable at home, annoying out here—was now costing me time, energy, and patience.

If your pack is a mess, you spend more time and attention on your gear than on your surroundings.  
If your body is a mess, you spend more attention on pain and risk management than on the things that brought you there in the first place.

Both are forms of disintegration.

### Trail Family, in Slow Motion

You do not intend to build a trail family. It just happens.

The first person I recognized from day to day was a younger guy in his thirties with a pack that looked like he had stolen it from a dollhouse.

He introduced himself at a water source as “Jet,” the kind of trail name you can only pull off if you are actually fast.

His pack could not have weighed more than twenty pounds fully loaded, probably less. He moved like his joints had not gotten the memo about gravity yet—long stride, easy gait, the kind of efficiency that comes only from a lot of miles and a willingness to be uncomfortable.

“You thru‑hiking?” he asked, as if there were any other reason to be out here with a full pack.

“That’s the plan,” I said. “We’ll see what the body thinks.”

He grinned.

“Body will catch up,” he said. “Mind’s the hard part.”

The second familiar face was closer to my age.

Her name was Carla. Late sixties, if I had to guess. Small, wiry, moving with the careful confidence of someone who knew exactly what her knees and hips could handle.

I met her sitting on a rock one morning, adjusting her shoes with the kind of patience that comes only from a few injuries too many.

“New boots?” I asked.

She shook her head.

“Old feet,” she said. “The boots are fine.”

We laughed, not because it was a great line, but because it was true.

The third was a man named Tom, a little older than me, whom I first noticed because he had a small, well‑organized pill organizer in his hand at camp one night.

Blood pressure meds. A statin. Something for reflux. Something for sleep.

He did not apologize for any of it. He took the pills, chased them with filtered cow‑tank water, and crawled into his tent with the practiced efficiency of someone who had been managing a fragile system for years.

“You out here for the whole thing?” I asked through the fabric as we both settled in.

“That’s the fantasy,” he said. “My cardiologist signed off on a section. We’ll see how far I get.”

Three different versions of aging:

- Jet, all elasticity and optimism and cheap gear, using trail as one more large canvas.  
- Carla, precise and tuned, making a hundred small adjustments to keep the machine running.  
- Tom, carrying a literal reminder that his internal systems needed chemical help.

And me, somewhere in the middle, with a pack that weighed more than Jet’s, fewer miles than Carla, and more medications than I wanted to admit to myself.

We did not hike together all day. We leapfrogged.

Sometimes I would see Jet disappearing up a climb, legs turning over in that infuriatingly smooth way.  
Sometimes I would pass Carla when she stopped to tape a toe or adjust a strap.  
Sometimes Tom would catch up to me when I took one photo too many and forgot to eat for a couple of hours.

We were not a family yet. We were an emerging pattern.

Elias saw it before I did.

### Elias Takes Attendance

One evening, a few days after I had met all three, we ended up at the same campsite: a small flat area near a wash, just enough room for four tents and a shared cooking spot.

Jet arrived first, dumped his pack with the casual violence of someone whose shoulders are still on good terms with their connective tissue, and started boiling water on a tiny stove that looked like it weighed less than my spoon.

Carla came in next, slower, taking care with every foot placement even on the relatively flat approach. She took her shoes off carefully, massaged her feet, and then began her own methodical setup.

Tom and I came in last, within a few minutes of each other, trading the kind of labored jokes that men make when they are more tired than they want to admit.

Elias was already there.

I did not see him arrive. I looked up from my stove and he was sitting on a rock at the edge of the site, just inside the circle of headlamp light, watching us like a teacher taking attendance.

“Nice crew,” he said quietly as I walked over with my mug.

“Accidental,” I said.

“Most crews are,” he said.

We sat and watched.

Jet ate quickly, some ultra‑light concoction of dehydrated everything, then pulled out a phone, checked a few things in airplane mode, and started talking about his next section: water carries, elevation, how many miles he thought he could stack before his next town day.

Carla moved more slowly, eating, stretching, making notes in a small journal.

Tom took his pills, laid them out in a neat line, chased them with water, and leaned back against a rock with a sigh that contained equal parts satisfaction and fatigue.

“What do you see?” Elias asked.

I shrugged.

“Three different ways to be out here,” I said. “Three different sets of constraints.”

“Start closer,” he said. “What do you see in their bodies?”

I looked again.

“Jet has margin,” I said. “He can make mistakes and get away with them. Carla has knowledge. She’s not strong in the same way, but she knows exactly how to protect what she has. Tom has…commitment. He’s out here with a system that most men would use as an excuse to stay home.”

Elias nodded.

“Now pull back,” he said. “What do you see in their lives?”

I hesitated.

“Jet looks like someone who still believes time is infinite,” I said. “Carla looks like someone who knows it isn’t, and refuses to waste what she has left. Tom looks like someone who has already met his limits and is trying to renegotiate with them.”

“And you?” Elias asked.

“Somewhere between Carla and Tom,” I said. “Not as tuned as she is. Not as constrained as he is. Too willing to pretend I’m closer to Jet than I am.”

He smiled.

“Not bad,” he said.

He picked up a small twig, turned it in his fingers.

“This,” he said, nodding at the campsite, “is a microcosm of what you wrote about back home without quite understanding it.”

“Wrote about?” I said.

“You know the patterns,” he said. “You have read the studies. You have watched men age in offices and boardrooms and family gatherings. You know how disintegration looks in slow motion:

- Bodies that used to be tools becoming liabilities.  
- Minds that used to be sharp getting dulled by routine and sedation.  
- Relationships that used to be active turning into stories told in the past tense.

Now you are seeing it with fewer filters.”

He nodded toward Jet.

“If he keeps doing roughly what he’s doing, with a few adjustments,” he said, “he will probably carry a lot of capacity into older age.”

He nodded toward Carla.

“If she keeps doing what she’s doing,” he said, “she will squeeze a lot of life out of the margin she has left.”

He nodded toward Tom.

“If he keeps doing what he’s doing,” he said, “he may or may not finish this trail. But he will finish his years knowing he did not surrender without testing his system.”

He looked at me.

“The question,” he said, “is which version of yourself you are designing for.”

I watched Jet check his route for tomorrow, Carla carefully massage her feet, Tom line up his pills for the morning.

“I thought I was out here to get away from work,” I said.

“You are out here to see your work,” Elias said. “Except now the system you are designing is your own last twenty years.”

He let that sink in.

“The drift you have allowed at home,” he said, “shows up here as lost water, wasted movement, extra pain, bad sleep, unnecessary risk. On the trail, the feedback is faster. At home, it takes longer, but it is just as real.”

He stood up, stretching his legs.

“Disintegration,” he said, “is not a moral failure. It is what happens when you stop actively maintaining integration in a body and a life that don’t have as much spare capacity as they used to. You can see it in your pack, in your body, in your calendar, in your habits.”

He looked down at me.

“You came here because something in you sensed that,” he said. “The question is whether you are going to keep pretending, or whether you are going to use what you see out here to design the next phase.”

He walked back toward the edge of camp, leaving me with my cooling dinner and the soft sounds of other people getting ready for sleep.

Jet was still talking about miles.  
Carla was still stretching.  
Tom was already snoring.

I looked at my own pack, my own feet, my own pill bottle.

For the first time in a long time, I did not feel like a CEO on sabbatical, or a guy on an adventure to tell stories about later.

I felt like a man with a system in front of him that needed an honest audit.
