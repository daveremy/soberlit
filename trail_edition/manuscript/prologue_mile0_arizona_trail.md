## Prologue — Mile 0 on the Arizona Trail

I did not come to the Arizona Trail for a spiritual experience.

I came because I was restless and a little afraid, and because the numbers on my life did not add up the way they used to.

It was October. I had just turned sixty‑four. For most of my adult life I had been a tech CEO, the kind of job that turns days into screens and meetings and sitting. Years of flight schedules and board decks and late‑night email had done their work. My sport, the one I had always told myself I would get serious about “when I had more time,” had become a mix of genuine competition and elaborate excuses. I was fit enough on paper. Not fit enough that I trusted my body the way I once did.

A few months before, I had gone out on a three‑day backpacking trip to “test gear” and “see how it felt.”

It felt terrible.

Five miles with a moderate pack left me more rattled than I wanted to admit. Knees complaining. Back tight. Heart and lungs louder than they used to be. Sleep in the tent was patchy. The whole time, a quiet voice in the back of my head kept repeating a single line:

Something has to change.

I had been drinking for decades.

Not headline material. Not the kind of story that ends in a crash or an intervention. Just the quiet, steady hum of “a few” most nights. Enough that my sleep was worse, my recovery slower, my evenings hazier, my mornings a little more compromised than I wanted to admit.

I had read enough to know what that meant—Lancet curves, hippocampal shrinkage, REM suppression, inflammation, atrial fibrillation. I had a lifetime of systems thinking behind me. I knew how to model risk and capacity.

I was not acting like a man who knew those things.

So when I told people I was going to hike the Arizona Trail, end to end, I used phrases that made sense to them:

- “Bucket list.”  
- “Time to reset.”  
- “I’ve always wanted to see this desert on foot.”

Those sentences were true. They were not complete.

The more private version sounded more like:

- “If I do not change something, I am going to slide into a long, comfortable disintegration.”  
- “If I keep drinking the way I drink and moving the way I move, I am going to become a man I would not have respected ten years ago.”  
- “If I do not give myself a big enough jolt, I am going to keep telling myself stories about how I will ‘dial things in’ someday.”

The Arizona Trail became my jolt.

It is not Everest. It is not the AT or the PCT. It is a long, rough, beautiful line—over seven hundred miles through Arizona—desert, canyons, forest, ridges, windmills, cow tanks, trail towns. A place where you can walk long enough that your life at home feels both close and far, and where “I’ll start later” does not work on any layer of your system.

On the morning I started, the sky was clear and the air had that thin, dry edge you only really feel in the desert.

My pack was heavier than I wanted it to be. My knees and feet and back had already registered their displeasure at the weight in the parking lot. I took the obligatory trailhead photos. I sent the obligatory texts.

And then I stood alone at the sign, looking at a narrow strip of dirt disappearing into scrub and low hills, and I felt something that did not fit easily into a social media caption.

I felt like a man about to run a systems test on himself.

I did not have language for it at the time. I had an itch and a map and enough stubbornness to put one foot in front of the other.

I walked.

The first miles were the usual mix of novelty and self‑consciousness. Adjust the straps. Check the map. Wonder if you forgot something critical. Hear your own breathing. Feel your heartbeat and ask quietly whether you have been lying to yourself about your conditioning.

The desert was not interested in any of that.

It was interested in whether my feet would hold up on the rocks, whether my skin would tolerate the sun, whether I had brought enough water to reach the next source.

By midday, the sun was higher, the trail dustier, and my enthusiasm had worn off enough that the internal commentary got louder.

Why are you doing this?  
You could be home.  
You could be on a court, or on a bike, or at a desk, doing something you are good at.  
You are not twenty‑five.  
You are not even forty‑five.

The answer I gave myself was blunt:

Precisely.

I did not meet Elias that first day in a flash of light or a mystical encounter.

I met him the way you meet most important people in late life: gradually, and then all at once, and then you realize he has been around longer than you thought.

It started at a water source.

The guidebook called it a “tank,” which turned out to mean a shallow, murky pond with a thin skin of algae on top and cow prints around the edges. There was a pipe trickling slightly clearer water into the pond. A couple of hikers were already there, filtering and swearing and making the same jokes everyone makes in those places.

I dropped my pack, pulled out my filter, and kneeled at the edge.

“You’re late,” a voice said behind me.

The words were in my language, but the tone was not.

Not scolding. Not sarcastic. Just…factual. Like a log entry.

I turned.

He looked like a man somewhere between sixty and eighty, which is to say his age was more a matter of interpretation than of skin. Lean but not gaunt. Sun‑lined without looking brittle. Clothes that were too practical to be new. Eyes that had the peculiar combination of seriousness and amusement I had seen only in people who had watched a lot of bad decisions play out and were still willing to help.

“I’m on schedule,” I said, automatically defensive. “Started this morning. Plan is—”

He held up a hand.

“Not late to the tank,” he said. “Late to your life.”

I felt the heat in my face before I felt the heat of the sun.

“Excuse me?” I said.

He sat down on a rock as if we had already agreed to talk.

“You are starting a systems overhaul in your mid‑sixties,” he said. “Better than not starting. Later than necessary. The good news is you still have enough capacity and agency left to make it worth doing.”

He said the words “capacity” and “agency” as if they were variables in an equation, not slogans.

“Who are you?” I asked.

He smiled.

“I am what you would get,” he said, “if you took your better instincts, your worst scares, a few thousand pages of gerontology, cardiology, and psychology, and gave them a body that has made most of the mistakes you are trying to avoid.”

He reached for his bottle, took a measured sip, and looked at me.

“You can call me Elias,” he said, pronouncing it “EE‑lie‑us”—the middle like “lie,” which I try never to do.

I did not believe him, of course. Not literally.

I assumed he was another hiker with a dry sense of humor and a good line in trail patter. A retired doctor, maybe, or a coach, or an engineer who had decided to reinvent himself as a desert philosopher.

But as the miles accumulated, and the conversations accumulated, and the systems he talked about started to match what I was feeling in my heart and my knees and my mood and my sleep, the exact ontology of Elias mattered less.

Mentor, memory, hallucination, composite, person—I stopped worrying about it.

What mattered was that he knew how men like me fall apart, and how to put a life back together in a way that could survive the remaining miles.

The Arizona Trail gave us the lab.

Elias gave me the language.

This is the story of what I learned walking with him.
