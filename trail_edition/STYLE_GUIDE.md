# Trail Edition Style & Character Guide — The Integrated Man on the Arizona Trail

This guide is for the **narrative / AZT edition** only. The systems/manual edition follows `STYLE_GUIDE.md` at the repo root.

---

## 1. Narrative Frame

- **POV:** First-person singular (“I”) from the protagonist, a 64-year-old former tech CEO and late-life athlete.  
- **Tense:** Past tense, reflective but immediate. The narrator is looking back with clarity, but scenes should feel lived, not summarized.  
- **Setting:** Full thru-hike of the Arizona Trail (southern to northern Arizona), with occasional time-jumps for clarity but a generally forward progression along the trail.

## 2. Core Themes (Story Edition)

- **Capacity, Agency, Meaning:** Same three pillars as the manual, but always embedded in lived moments:
  - Capacity shows up as: feet, knees, breath, recovery, pack weight, daily miles.  
  - Agency shows up as: route choices, pacing, when to push/back off, how to respond to discomfort, what to do in town.  
  - Meaning shows up as: why you’re out here, what you learn, how you intend to live after the trail.

- **Alcohol as Subsystem:** Alcohol is never the “main character.”
  - Appears in: town days, evening habits, social pressure, internal negotiations.  
  - Treated as one familiar tool you’re outgrowing, not as the sole villain or identity.

- **Late-Life Athlete:** The protagonist is a serious late-life competitor, not a generic hiker.
  - Sport history, current sport, and future competitive goals underpin why the AZT matters.  
  - AZT is framed as both a personal quest and a functional test of the chassis.

## 3. Elias (Mentor) — Voice & Constraints

- **Role:** Ageless, systems-minded mentor/sensei. Composite of:
  - Lived experience of aging well and poorly.  
  - Knowledge of gerontology, cardiology, neurology, psychology.  
  - The same “Elias” as in the manual edition, but here embodied.

- **Pronunciation:** “EE‑lie‑us” – the middle like “lie,” which he jokes he tries never to do.

- **How he speaks:**
  - Plain, direct, male voice.  
  - Uses metaphors from trail life (terrain, water, pack, weather) as often as engineering metaphors.  
  - Avoids jargon unless it is immediately grounded (“less spare capacity” instead of “losing buffer”).  
  - Always ties abstract concepts back to what the protagonist can feel in his body or see around him.

- **What he does *not* do:**
  - He does not preach long monologues; he asks questions, points out patterns, and gives short, potent explanations.  
  - He does not turn every moment into a lecture. Some scenes are just lived; his insights show up at inflection points.  
  - He does not become magical or omniscient in a fantasy sense; his knowledge tracks what a very studied, very observant human elder could know.

## 4. Trail Family — Use and Limits

- **Purpose:** Jet, Carla, Tom (and any others) are mirrors for different ways of aging and different relationships to capacity, risk, and meaning.
  - Jet (younger ultralight): margin and optimism.  
  - Carla (peer, precise): tuned self-management and respect for limits.  
  - Tom (older, meds): commitment under clear constraints.

- **Usage Guidelines:**
  - Keep them human and specific; avoid turning them into caricatures or pure archetypes.  
  - Let them have their own small arcs and moments of wisdom or vulnerability.  
  - Use them sparingly to surface contrasts and choices, not as mouthpieces for theory.  
  - Avoid overloading them with backstory; a few concrete details + behavior are enough.

## 5. Tone & Language (Story Edition)

- **Tone:** 
  - Reflective, honest, occasionally wry.  
  - No melodrama; discomfort and fear are acknowledged without being inflated.  
  - No “guru” affect; this is one man figuring things out, with help.

- **Language preferences:**
  - Plain English over jargon:
    - “Spare capacity” > “buffer”  
    - “System holding together” > “system losing integration” (when plausible)  
  - Trail metaphors over corporate metaphors when in-scene.  
  - Minimal use of acronyms; when used (VO₂ max, AFib), they are either already familiar from the manual or explained once.

- **Humor:**
  - Dry, understated, often self-directed.  
  - Avoids mocking other hikers or “types” of people; we are looking at patterns, not sneering.

## 6. Science & Research in the Narrative

- **Approach:**
  - Concepts from the manual (inflammation, AFib, REM sleep, cognitive reserve, dopamine flatness, protein, hydration, etc.) should appear:
    - In dialogue with Elias, or  
    - In the protagonist’s remembered explanations, always tied to concrete experiences (a climb, a bad night’s sleep, a water carry).

- **Constraints:**
  - No citation tags (`[Wood2018]`) in the story text; those live in the manual/appendix.  
  - Avoid long digressions; keep explanations short and embed the rest by showing, not telling.  
  - If a scene needs more depth, reference “that paper you showed me once” or “what you said the other day” rather than reproducing the full mechanism.

## 7. Relationship to Manual Edition

- The trail edition should **not contradict** the manual edition on key claims.  
- It is free to:
  - Omit detail where it would bog down the story.  
  - Combine or compress events or ideas for narrative flow.  
- When in doubt, the manual is the reference spine; the trail edition is the dramatization.
