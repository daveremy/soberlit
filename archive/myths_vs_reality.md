# Myths vs Reality (Problem-Focused)

> Debunk myths with evidence; keep solutions for later chapters.

## Myth: "A little is good for my heart"
- **Reality:** Stroke, heart failure, and fatal hypertension rise steadily above ~1 drink/day ([Wood2018]); WHO: "risk increases with any consumption" ([WHO2023]). The "benefit" vanishes when biases are fixed.
- **The evidence:** Cardiovascular health improves with reduced intake; movement, BP control, sleep, and nutrition provide protection without alcohol.

## Myth: "It helps me sleep"
- **Reality:** Alcohol shortens sleep latency but suppresses REM/SWS (≈10–40% early-night reduction; [Roehrs1999], [RoehrsRothReview]) and fragments late-night sleep; HRV drops.
- **The evidence:** For real rest, use an alcohol-free wind-down; deeper REM/SWS and better next-day energy follow.

## Myth: "It's just one glass; there's a safe floor"
- **Reality:** Alcohol is a Group 1 carcinogen; per +10 g/day raises breast (~1.05), colorectal men (~1.07), oral (~1.17), esophageal SCC (~1.30) risks ([Bagnardi2015]). No safe cancer threshold ([WHO2023]).
- **The evidence:** Less is safer; none is safest, every skipped drink lowers cumulative cancer risk.

## Myth: "It relaxes me"
- **Reality:** Sedation flips to rebound anxiety as BAC falls; higher use doubles depression odds (AOR ~2.0; [Boden2011]); anxiety comorbidity OR ~1.94 ([Lees2020]). Sleep loss and cortisol rebound worsen stress.
- **The evidence:** True relaxation comes from sleep you can trust, breath work, and being present, alcohol-free.

## Myth: "It makes me more social"
- **Reality:** Any social ease is brief; costs include impaired judgment, conflict risk, next-day anxiety, and poor sleep ([Lees2020]).
- **The evidence:** Social skill + energy + confidence improve without alcohol; scripts and sober plans outperform a buzz.

## Myth: "Moderate is safe for my brain"
- **Reality:** "Moderate" intake (14–21 UK units/week) linked to hippocampal atrophy (OR 3.4; >30 units/week OR 5.8; [Topiwala2017]); dementia risk ~17% higher above 14 units/week ([Sabia2018]).
- **The evidence:** Clarity and memory improve alcohol-free; brains respond better to zero than "moderate."

## Myth: "It won't affect my meds"
- **Reality:** Bleed risk with anticoagulants/antiplatelets ([NIAAAClinGuide]); hypotension with BP meds; hypoglycemia with insulin/sulfonylureas ([NIAAAClinGuide]); profound sedation/resp depression with benzos/opioids/sleep aids ([FDABoxed]/Beers).
- **The evidence:** Staying clear keeps meds safer and more effective; alcohol-free simplifies polypharmacy.

## Myth: "It's just a nightcap; no big safety risk"
- **Reality:** Acute risk is dose-dependent: non-motor injury OR 1.30 per +10 g alcohol on an occasion (≈24 at 140 g; [Taylor2010]); hip fracture RR 1.20 at highest vs lowest ([Ke2023]).
- **The evidence:** An alcohol-free night means steadier balance, fewer falls, and safer sleep.

## Myth: "My liver is fine, and alcohol doesn't cause weight gain"
- **Reality:** Fatty liver develops even at "moderate" intake levels and progresses faster after 60 when liver metabolism slows; most have no symptoms until damage is advanced. Alcohol is 7 cal/g, blocks fat oxidation (liver prioritizes alcohol clearance), dysregulates appetite hormones (increases ghrelin, decreases leptin), and drives visceral fat accumulation through sleep disruption, cortisol elevation, and insulin resistance.
- **The evidence:** Fatty liver reverses within weeks of stopping, fat oxidation resumes, appetite regulation normalizes, and inflammation drops.
