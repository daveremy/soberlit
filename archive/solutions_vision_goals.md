# Vision & Goals (Successful Aging, Clear Choice)

> Anchor the “why”: living vibrant, connected, and purposeful—alcohol-free by conviction, not avoidance.

## Define your future objectives
- Picture the next 5–20 years: health (strength, balance, sleep), relationships (partner/family/grandkids/friends), contribution (volunteering, mentoring, creating), joy (hobbies/adventures) ([Hershfield2009a] future self-continuity: stronger connection to your future self drives better health decisions).
- Include end-of-life clarity: how you want to be present and remembered ([RoweKahn1997] successful aging: engagement with life as core pillar).

## Keep goals after retirement
- Set 3–5 goals that excite you (movement, learning, service, relationships) ([BaltesSoc1990] SOC model: Selection—choose meaningful goals that fit your changing capacities).
- Break into quarterly actions; review monthly.

## Firm stance
- "Even if alcohol is here and no one is looking, I don't want it. It does not align with my vision for my vision" ([Lakhiani], [Manfredi2020] "unfuckwithable": firm relationship with alcohol, indifferent to external pressure).
- Pair urges with [HALT]+Thirst/Stress: meet the real need (food, rest, movement, connection).

## Daily anchors
- Morning: revisit vision briefly; one affirmation; choose a small step toward a goal.
- Evening: note wins and alignment; if misaligned, adjust the plan without guilt.

## Connection
- Build and protect relationships that fit your vision; schedule regular touchpoints.
- Choose social contexts that match your goals (movement + social, learning groups, service).
